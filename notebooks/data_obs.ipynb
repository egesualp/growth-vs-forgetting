And as good as we are at confining plasmas, we are not yet good enough to make an economical power plant. We think we know how to build a tokamak that can produce more thermal power than we put into it, and in fact we are building a science experiment (ITER) to study just that. \\n\\nBut creating a positive net power is just one part of building an economical power plant. There are many issues that we still need to address before we can build an economical power plant. There is no single issue that has supreme importance. Below I list a few broad areas that we need to address. There are multiple physics and technological issues that contribute to each area, and my list is not complete.\\n\\nLong Pulse: A power plant needs to be able to run continuously 24 hours a day 7 days week. Most fusion experiments only operate for a few seconds at a time. This is actually long enough to do the science that we need to understand confinement. But we need to develop the science and technologies to extend the pulse lengths and operate steady state.\\n\\nDisruptions: Tokamak's can go unstable and suddenly lose confinement. These sudden loss of confinement events can damage the reactor. We need to develop better control of the plasma to avoid disruptions, and also develop mitigation systems to protect the reactor in the event of an disruption. \\n\\nMaterials: The inside of a burning fusion reactor is a very harsh environment. We need to develop materials that can withstand this environment for prolonged periods of time.\\n\\nSize: Right now we only know how to build a large burning fusion reactor. Large reactors are expensive and costly. In order to be economically viable (and to speed up the rate research) we need to find a way to shrink the size of a burning reactor.  \\n\\nPredictability: Plasma physics is a challenging field of study.

This takes visible photons and converts it into an electrical signal.\\n\\nThe visible photons are generated by scintillation events.  This happens when a free electron roaming around inside your scintillator falls into a lower energy state.\\n\\nFree electrons are generated from ionization events.  Usually, you have one very energetic electron that comes crashing through your scintillator, ionizing hundreds or thousands of atoms along its path.\\n\\nThese very energetic electrons were generated through interactions between your gamma rays and the atoms of the scintillator - compton scatter, photoelectric effect, and pair production.\\n\\nSo the only thing your detector is able to see is ionization energy left behind by the gamma ray.  Let\\'s say one of your gamma rays undergoes compton scattering, and subsequently escapes.  Your detector would see a signal equal to the energy of the compton electron, but not the gamma ray.\\n\\nIn pair production, you often see \"escape peaks.\"  This is when one or both of the 511 keV annihilation photons escapes.

Second of all, if we go ahead and assume a Unitary interpretation of QM, then the answer to this question is necessarily going to be somewhat circular, because you are not asking about actual humans, but made-up humans with made-up properties, and if you are going to do that you can choose a made-up type of human with a consciousness that is aware of being in superposition, or a made-up type of human whose consciousness is unaware of being in superposition. So your question ultimately depends on the material nature of consciousness; it\\'s not so simple as just imagining that your consciousness is itself reduced to a spin-up or spin-down state. My understanding is that most biologists think that brain states can be described classically, i.e. that quantum mechanics is not a necessary ingredient for consciousness. In that case, the answer to your question (again assuming Unitary QM) is that if a human is put into superposition (for example by an experimenter measuring something to be spin-up or spin-down), then you have two separate consciousnesses or \"worlds\" that are unaware of each other, due to linearity of the wave function. I.e. in the Schrodinger equation there is no interaction between parts of a wave function in superposition, so they cannot be aware of each other.

Once the process is complete, you wind up with these spherical patches of sandstone cemented by carbonates surrounding the place where thee organic matter (now eaten) used to be. The rest of the surrounding sandstone may be cemented by a different process, or may have remained more porous and be less thoroughly cemented.

In the distal tubule, it allows for better reabsorption of urea into the interstitium (the area outside of the tubule in the kidney) which increases the kidney's ability to passively pull water out of the tubule in the connecting and collecting ducts. This is because water has a tendency to move from an area of low solute concentration to high solute concentration.

In functional-type scoliosis, the curve in the spine is caused by an abnormality elsewhere in the body, such as one leg being shorter than the other. This type can be fixed by correcting the abnormality, such as having the patient wear special shoes to level out the leg length discrepancy. In neuromuscular scoliosis, the curvature arises from the bones in the spine which fail to develop properly prior to being born. This type is very difficult to treat, as it is the bones themselves that need to be changed. If treatment is not sought, the condition will only worsen. Braces do not usually work, and cannot correct the deformed bones. People with this type  have to undergo surgery to correct the curve. During surgery rods and hooks are used to correct the curve, and then a spinal fusion is performed to hold the spine in place.The fusion takes bone from elsewhere in the body, and grafts it to the vertebrae. This makes the spine more rigid and straight. \\n\\nAnother type of scoliosis is degenerative scoliosis. This type, which is seen in older adults, is the result of arthritis which can weaken the tissues and ligaments associated with the spine, or from osteoporosis, which reduces bone mass. This type is difficult to treat because you would first have to treat the arthritis or osteoporosis, which may not be possible.',\n",

Inspiration time was prolonged compared to cows (ca 2 to 3 s vs 0.9 s respectively), expiration time was similar (1.62 s vs 1.67 s) and the average ratio of inspiration time to expiration time was 1.2 in giraffes and 0.6 in cows (Patterson et al., 1965).

They concluded that giraffe compensated for a long neck by having a trachea that was narrower than expected (Hugh-Jones et al., 1978), with the consequence of greater resistance to airflow especially during exercise. The greater resistance explained the longer inspiratory time found by Patterson et al. (1965). Langman et al.

Simulating 1g of air for example, would require simulating around 10^22 atoms.

Simulating how electrons in a molecule interact is active research and simulating a single complex molecule already requires supercomputers. \\n\\nThis even, is still neglecting how neutrons and protons and nuclei interact. For this, it even more relies on approximations as their interactions come from the interactions of their internal quarks and gluons, which is incredibly complicated - even theoretically: we know how to write down the basic equation that we are pretty sure predicts all of this, but we don\\'t have all the techniques ironed out for how we would extract predictions even for describing the interaction between one proton and one neutron.

What we can do however, is take these equations and figure out special cases to find approximate behaviors - using equations not simulations - and then simulate these special cases. You can show that an approximate description of internal molecular dynamics reduces to simpler force models between molecule, and that you can explain the basic properties of fluids from these forces. Each time, taking the approximate description and working on them is a better choice. Not only for obtaining predictions, but also but also for *understanding* what is going on. A simulation tells you if your model fits reality, but it can be hard to understand what is really going on inside: what are the elementary mechanisms? Are some things more important than others? Making approximate descriptions tells you this kind of information: if you neglect some effects and still describe reality correctly in some regime, you *understood* what is going on: it\\'s what you did not neglect that drives the phenomenon you are describing.',\n",

The overall structure of spacetime can be curved, like a ball or a saddle or just flat, and we measure it to be flat. Really flat. If you work out how that must be from equations governing the expansion and curvature of spacetime through cosmologic history, you work out that it had to start out within about 1 part in 10^62 of flat at the start, which also implies that our Universe has precisely enough energy density to be flat, not more, not less (to within that error). Why does it have to be this number? Our Universe just happens to have that much matter and radiation and other stuff in it to within that amount? We have a problem with that because of the exact amount of fine tuning that went into those initial conditions that made the Universe. So yes, you\\'re right, maybe it could have been that way to start. However, inflation allows you to have many more arbitrary values and then still get to the level of flatness we see today. So it removes those problems of fine tuning altogether, and the same is true on the other problems inflation solves, including the one you initially brought up.\\n\\nAs for the things we\\'re okay with that you mention in your last paragraph, there\\'s strong observational support that explains how the Universe must have expanded, the temperature of the Universe as a function of time, what physical processes must have occurred at different times, etc. We don\\'t just accept those.

For a droplet, this means it forms a sphere, since a sphere has the smallest possible surface area for a given volume.  However as water falls from a faucet it is in a column (i.e. a continuous cylinder shape) and so the water eventually breaks up into separate droplets which overall have a smaller total surface area than the falling column of water.\\n\\nHowever that's just a qualitative description of what happens.  The actual analysis of the Plateau-Rayleigh instability allows you to quantitatively predict (with very high accuracy) what the actual frequency and size of the droplets will be, and how long it takes for them to form.\\n\\nThis isn't unique to water either.  It will happen to any liquid, although the final result depends upon such things as the initial diameter and flow rate of the column of liquid, and the surface tension of the liquid.\\n\\nIn more general terms, if liquids always try to minimize their surface area, you would expect that when you, say for instance, drop a bucket of water into the air that it would stay together in a spherical shape.  However when the mass of liquid becomes large compared to strength of the surface tension, surface tension simply isn't strong enough to bring it all together and other forces (such as air resistance) tend to push the mass of liquid apart into sheets and columns.  As the liquid spreads out and gets thin enough, the total surface area will become large enough that the total surface tension will be less if it breaks into separate droplets, and so it does so *a la* the Plateau-Rayleigh instability.

It has always been hard, however, to rationalize how any individual part of a machine could evolve in the absence of the other parts. But to imagine that they could not evolve would be to fall into  the \"irreducibly complex trap\". Evolution is step-wise, and this is important to keep in mind. I know more about this topic in the context of nuclear receptors, so I will use them as an example, but the thought process can be generalized to most ligand/receptor families. The predominant theory is that the first \"nucelar receptor\" was likely a DNA binding protein that had acquired a new domain/mutation that allowed it to interact with things. That is, essentially evolution created an orphan nuclear receptor. This new \"ligand binding domain\" likely wasn\\'t very specific at first, and bound to a large class of molecules. The evolutionary magic started to happen once chance interactions between molecule and receptor were enough to influence cell signaling. The first cells that learned tricks for integrating information about their environment into how DNA was regulated were enormously advantaged, and thus nuclear receptors became selected for. Subsequent gene duplications allowed for the divergence of the multiple nuclear receptor gene/ligand pairs we can observe today.\\n\\nSo while the small molecules were always floating around, they were never truly \\'ligands\\' until evolution began to spit out these messed up proteins that \\'bound things\\' in addition to their other tasks.

Then the next cycle, it\\'ll double again, and again, etc. such that your reaction well is 2^*x* times brighter, assuming perfect doubling, than when you started.\\n\\nNow, this number isn\\'t perfect. When you start your PCR or qPCR, it takes a bit of time to ramp up the \"doubling\" cycle, because the DNA molecules are limiting-- for the sample you put in, let\\'s say there are 1000 molecules, maybe only 250 get replicated in the first cycle (now you have 1500 instead of 2000 if there were perfect doubling), then maybe another 500 in the second, etc. By the end of your PCR, you get a plateau because your reagents (loose nucleotides) get used up and your Taq may have started denaturing. But that magic middle, you get exponential doubling (this is the point of inflection on the curve). That\\'s the critical part of the qPCR.\\n\\nWhy do qPCR? You can quantify DNA in a sample if you want. You\\'d do that if you\\'re doing some very sensitive application (like sequencing) where you want to make sure that you not only have the right concentration of DNA, but that you have the right concentration of the DNA you\\'re looking to sequence. This makes the actual sequencing process cheaper because you don\\'t under- or over-load your flow cell.\\n\\nMore commonly, though, qPCR is used to quantify RNA. You\\'d do this to see if a particular gene is being expressed more in one sample than another. For example, is an enzyme expressed more in liver tissue or in kidney tissue? Is it expressed more in mouse 1\\'s liver, who just took an experimental drug, than in mouse 2\\'s liver, the control? \\n\\nTo address questions like this, you would use a kit to extract RNA from your sample and then use reverse transcriptase to turn all of your sample\\'s RNA into DNA (because it\\'s more stable). Then you load the DNA into your qPCR reaction. If your gene of interest was more highly expressed in mouse 1, then when you do qPCR, you will see the exponential amplification occur SOONER in sample 1, because there was a higher concentration of this transcript in mouse 1\\'s liver in the first place. The difference in cycle counts between sample 1 and sample 2\\'s point of exponential amplification reflect how many TIMES more transcript was in mouse 1 than mouse 2\\'s liver, because each cycle doubles the amount of DNA. So if mouse 1 had 20 cycles, and mouse 2 had 22 cycles until exponential amplification, then there are (2 cycles x 2 doubles = ) 4 times more of your gene of interest expressed in mouse 1 than mouse 2.\\n\\nBut wait! You may ask. What if I accidentally started with more of mouse 1\\'s liver than mouse 2\\'s liver, so there\\'s just more DNA overall? We control for that by using housekeeping genes as a control. Housekeeping genes are highly expressed in all tissues. We normalize our experimental transcript to the housekeeping transcripts so that we can make sure that our samples have the same amount of total DNA.\\n\\nI think that\\'s it.\\n\\nNow, more questions: Is it true that the amount of transcript = the amount of active enzyme? Is more enzyme always meaningful? That, we don\\'t know.',\n",

Sometimes higher, sometimes lower. But we can also predict *how far off* the measurement is likely to be, so we can tell if something is probably (or not) random chance.\\n\\nIn the case of the 750 GeV excess, in 2015, each detector saw some extra photon pairs. The probability of one detector seeing that many extra pairs *at this specific energy* was something like 0.1% or less--so pretty surprising, right? However, one has to consider that there are many possible places for random excesses to appear. Accounting for that (in this particular search) meant that the probability of an excess this big *somewhere* was something like 2%-5%. Less exciting. But since a *second* detector saw it in the *same place* we get to combine these probabilities, and the odds of it happening became something like 0.005%--less than one time out of ten thousand, doing a naive combination.

So complicated that I\\'ve had a really hard time typing up the following response, and have typed things out and deleted them a number of times (I probably typed about twice as many words as you\\'re seeing). There are two different ways to approach this question. You could be asking something along the lines of \\n\\n >  How far back would I have to go before I share a \"bloodline\" individual ancestor with another individual randomly drawn from the population.\\n\\nTo answer:\\n\\nFirst off, there\\'s significant heterogeneity because different populations have different degrees of relatedness. Say we draw two random humans alive today, and we get one [San Bushman](_URL_5_), and one European. Those populations diverged from one another ~150,000 years ago, so those two individuals aren\\'t going to share a common ancestor until at least 150,000 years back. Say we get one European and one Asian. These populations have been separated for about 30,000 years, so they\\'re unlikely to share any ancestors during that period.\\n\\nThe thing is, the previous statement is likely false. It\\'s entirely possible that some early european many thousands of years ago migrated east, and mated with someone in the middle east. That mating could, over the course of just a handfull of generations, lead to an astronomically high number of descendants. (If you have two kids, and each of them have two kids, and each of them have two kids, and each of them has two kids, it doesn\\'t take very long before everyone in the population can claim you as an ancestor.) If just one or a few of those descendants migrates south into Africa (or east into Asia), they could, within a few generations, be claimed as an ancestor to almost all of the individuals living in whatever population they mated into. This only has to happen once for it to be true that the most recent common ancestor of all individuals across the two populations lived only a few thousand years ago, maybe even less. \\n\\nThe process doesn\\'t necessarily happen in giant leaps as I\\'ve portrayed it. It\\'s probably much more of a slow wave of relatedness diffusing across the landscape as people migrated back and forth just a handful of miles at a time over the course of the generations. In fact, we in population genetics actually use [the exact same sort of equation](_URL_7_) to model the diffusion of genes across a population over time as physicists use to [model diffusion of heat](_URL_1_) across space over the course of time. \\n\\n**So the massively oversimplified answer is that most people probably share a common ancestor within the last few thousand years, with members of very divergent populations (say, Native Americans and San Bushmen) possibly being much more distant, and members of the same population (say, British people), all sharing a common ancestor within the last few hundred years)**\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, it\\'s pretty much impossible to actually reconstruct with certainty patterns of relatedness more than just a handful of generations back from genetic data. There are probably estimates out there, but I don\\'t know them, because relatedness at the genetic level gets really complicated (and thus they\\'re not terribly relevant to *genetic relatedness*, which is a much more interesting question, in my opinion).\\n\\nConsider:\\n\\nIf you have a sibling, on average you will share 50% of your genetic makeup. If you have a first cousin, on average you share 12.5% of your genetic makeup. If you have a second cousin, you will, on average, share 3.125% of your genetic makeup. If you keep going back farther and farther (third cousin, fourth cousin, fifth cousin, etc.), this number gets closer and closer to zero very quickly. But that number is just an average, and it has a variance which is decidedly non-zero. So that means that plenty of 10th cousins won\\'t share any genetic material at all from the common ancestor from which they are 10th cousins. No [alleles](_URL_0_) will have survived from one generation to the next in both lineages simultaneously such that they actually share genes \"identical by descent\", (as we say in population genetics) from that ancestor. They may be 8th cousins via a different common ancestor, and 13th cousins via another, and 13th cousins again via a different route and they may share some genetic material via those relationships (or not), but it\\'s entirely possible that they may not share any genetic material via that 10th cousin relationship that they have. Alternatively, it\\'s entirely possible that two individuals could be 20th cousins via one common ancestor, and may actually happen to share genetic material via that relationship, but might not share any genetic material via a 10th cousin relationship that they have.\\n\\nBasically, it all comes down to the fact that this stuff is highly stochastic (random), so there\\'s a lot of variance in how closely related any two individuals are at a particular genetic loci.\\n\\nMuch of the above (and the below) is derived from something called [coalescent theory](_URL_6_), which I\\'m now discovering is incredibly hard to explain in such a way that someone who\\'s not a population genetic PhD student will follow. So, I\\'m going to do something I don\\'t normally do, and offer an answer without a proper explanation, because I really don\\'t know how to offer an explanation without saying \"go read this textbook\" (for the brave/statistically inclined [Hudson, 1991](_URL_4_) is a good place to start, but you\\'re going to need a good genetics or statistics foundation):\\n\\nYou and your sibling share, on average, 50% of your genetic material \"Identical by descent\" from your parents. That means that if you pick a random DNA base pair, at 50% of them you will have received the same base pair at the same locus from the same parent. These base pairs are \"identical by descent with respect to your parents\". At the vast majority of the other base pairs in the genome you will also have identical base pairs (that is if they have an A, you will also have an A, if they have a G, you will also have a G), however. This is because your parents already shared identical base pairs at this location, because those base pairs are \"identical by descent\" with respect to some distant relative that your parents share (and because there\\'s been no mutation on the lineage leading to your parents from that common ancestor in order to make them different).\\n\\nSo the truly remarkable thing is that you if you draw two random individuals from the same population (i.e. European, Asian, Native American, one of any number of African populations), and assume a historic population size of 10,000 (which is fairly accurate for most ancient human populations prior to the population explosion of the last few thousand years), at any particular place in the genome, on average, you have to go back 20,000 generations (or 400,000 years) to find the ancestor with respect to which those two individuals are \"identical by descent\". The standard deviation of this estimate is itself 20,000 generations, however, so it\\'s just incredibly variable. This is true *independently* for different loci across the genome, as the process of [genetic recombination](_URL_2_) (and [independent assortment](_URL_3_) among chromosomes) causes different loci to have independent histories in the population.\\n\\nThis means that the relatedness of any two individuals is highly variable across different parts of their genome. So we come to the very counter intuitive, but nonetheless true, conclusion that most individuals share a \"bloodline\" most recent common ancestor that lived not long ago at all, but don\\'t actually share much genetic material via that particular relationship, and at the vast majority of genetic loci likely don\\'t have a common ancestor until many hundreds of thousands of years ago.\\n\\nOk, phew. I hope that was at least somewhat understandable.\\n\\n*edit: another super simple way to talk about it that I should have put in last night is that on average any two human beings drawn from the population will differ at about 1 in a 1000 DNA bases. This is something that we can empirically observe, ~~but which doesn\\'t necessarily tell us all that much about patterns of \"relatedness\" in the terms I\\'ve discussed above. So it\\'s really just a measure of how genetically \"similar\" two people are, and not how \"related\".~~ Eh, I would say that was a misstatement. It actually is a statement about average relatedness, which is indeed what the OP was asking about. It\\'s just that that figure leaves out all of the interesting information about how variable relatedness is across different parts of the genome, which I guess is why I saw fit to launch into this ridiculously long explanation.*',\n",

       "  'text': 'edit: wrong century. But I already wrote this, so here are some important discoveries of the 20th century as a preview:\\n\\n**The twin study.** The twin study revolutionized psychology by allowing us to quantify how much of our psychology is explained by genetic factors. The method is brilliantly simple: take two twins who share the same DNA, raise them in different environments, and then see how much of their psychology matches after a certain number of years. (No one does this for an experiment, but it happens naturally through adoption and so forth). Twin studies have led to an enormous number of shocking and counterintuitive discoveries. For example, our personality is about 40-60% genetic on average,^[1](_URL_5_),[2](_URL_1_) as are most mental health conditions (e.g., depression is about [40-50%](_URL_4_) genetic on average, while schizophrenia is around [80%](_URL_3_) on average, and substance abuse disorder is around [30-70%](_URL_7_) on average depending on the drug). \\n\\n**Lithium for bipolar disorder.** The discovery in the [1940\\'s](_URL_2_) that lithium could treat bipolar disorder revolutionized psychiatry (and by extension, psychology). This occurred at a time when many people thought that mental illnesses were the result of unfulfilled wish fulfillments or other Freudian explanations that have now been debunked (although to be fair, Freud\\'s ideas still have some supporters). The idea that mental health conditions like bipolar disorder could be treated effectively through chemistry was revolutionary, and lithium ushered in a new era for psychology. \\n\\n**Ketamine for depression.** Quote from a [paper](_URL_6_) published in 2012: *\"Recent studies report what is arguably the most important discovery in half a century: the therapeutic agent ketamine ... produces rapid (within hours) antidepressant actions in treatment-resistant depressed patients.\"* The discovery in the late 1990s to early 2000\\'s that ketamine (an anesthetic from the 1950\\'s) is also an extremely powerful and quickly-acting antidepressant is currently revolutionizing psychiatry. I could provide more examples of important drug discoveries, since there are many, but I\\'ll stop here for brevity.\\n\\n**Classical and operant conditioning.** This is cliché to include on this list, but it\\'s important. Before the early pioneers of conditioning like Pavlov and Skinner began studying this effect in the early 1900\\'s, no one had any clue how our behaviors could be learned from experiences. This early research on conditioning laid the foundation for us to begin understanding the cellular basis of learning and memory in the brain (for example, processes like [Hebb\\'s rule](_URL_0_)). \\n\\n**MRI**. Nuclear magnetic resonance was discovered in physics in the early 1940\\'s, but this also became an enormous discovery for psychology in the 1970\\'s with the invention of the MRI machine. Apart from its immediate applications in clinical psychology, MRI allowed researchers to study the brain non-invasively, with unprecedented clarity compared to earlier techniques. MRI also led to the development of fMRI, which now allows us to observe which parts of the brain activate in certain contexts. The significance of MRI and fMRI for psychology cannot be overstated. \\n\\n**Cognitive behavioral therapy.** It\\'s hard to say exactly when CBT was discovered, but its most popular clinical form has been around since around the 1980\\'s. Unlike some earlier forms of therapy, CBT is evidence-based and can be extremely effective for treating an enormous number of different mental health conditions. Although researchers are still trying to figure out exactly how it works, it\\'s now standard treatment for many different psychological conditions. For many conditions, the combination of therapy and medication appears to be more effective than either alone, so CBT can also make other treatments more effective.',\n",

If the orbital speed is below escape velocity, the path is a circle or ellipse; above escape velocity, it's a hyperbola; and exactly at escape velocity, it's a parabola.\\n\\nConsider what happens when you're trying to maneuver a satellite from the earth's surface into a hyperbolic escape orbit. In order to efficiently launch into this orbit, you want to burn in a direction tangential to the surface, with the burn ending near the hyperbola's vertex (the point of minimum aititude). But the direction that the satellite will ultimately end up traveling as it leaves the Earth's sphere of influence is different. It falls along another tangent line, or asymptote, which the hyperbola approaches in the limit of infinite distance (as seen in [this diagram](_URL_0_), where Earth is at the focus). The angle between the vertex tangent and the asymptote can be anywhere from zero to 90 degrees, depending on the launch speed.\\n\\nFurthermore, the final trajectory *relative to the Earth* is different from the final velocity *relative to the Sun*. In order to enter a transfer orbit that intersects both Earth and Mars, you need to gain speed in the direction of Earth's orbit, which lengthens the axis of your heliocentric orbit. But since Mars' orbit isn't coplanar with Earth's, there will be a significant north-south component to the velocity as well. And the resulting velocity vector will be in a different direction relative to the Earth's surface, depending on your latitude and the time of day.\\n\\nSo, all told, the launch direction that an interplanetary spacecraft has a pretty complicated relationship with where it will end up. The mission planners have to figure out what direction and speed they want to end up leaving earth in. Then, they have to find a departure orbit that *ends up* in that orbit, with a starting point that the launch vehicle can achieve (which includes letting the Earth's rotation provide some of the eastward velocity). And finally they have to wait for a launch window, when the Earth's rotation carries the launch site close enough to the hyperbola's vertex for an efficient launch.\",\n",

Also, a positive charge is induced on the surface of the earth, because the negative charge in the cloud is closer to the ground. Although some lightning strikes or flashes transfer the positive charge to the ground, positive flashes are rare in comparison to lightning flashes that transfer a negative charge to ground. \\n\\nFrom the appearance of a lightning flash, it is clear this charge transfer occurs in a channel with a width that is small compared to its length. Because air is normally an electrical insulator, it must break down so the conductive channel can form in order for a lightning flash to occur. This breakdown of the air between the cloud and the ground does not happen all at once. It happens in discrete steps of about 50 meters, with each step taking about one microsecond, and about 50 microseconds elapsing between steps. \\n\\nBecause of the discrete nature of this process, the initial channel of a lightning flash is called a \\'stepped leader\\'.\\n\\nAlthough the formation of a lightning channel is a result of the attraction between a negative charge in the cloud, and a positive charge induced into the ground, the individual steps are often far from vertical. This variability arises because the conductivity of the air is not uniform. The channel will tend to spread out to regions of higher conductivity. \\n\\nAs a result, the relatively short step size and the random distribution of such regions of higher conductivity render the channel jagged rather than smooth. Also, the point where the channel contacts the ground may be displaced a considerable distance horizontally from the point inside the cloud where the channel began.\"\\n\\nSource: \\n_URL_0_',\n",

       "  'text': 'In general, it\\'s always difficult to determine what the causal mechanism for a mass extinction could have been. Usually, the evidence for a causal mechanism is some combination of the particular selectivity in the extinction or lack thereof (e.g., mostly large land animals died or mostly tropical species or marine invertebrates or everything died, etc.), how quickly it occurred (inferred from the rock record of course) and co-occurrence of some event that might have been able to cause an extinction. For the end-Cretaceous extinction, we have pretty decent evidence that a major impact happened at about the right time. Besides the fact that we have an [impact crater](_URL_2_) dated to about the right age, there is the so-called [Iridium anomaly (check out section titled Alvarez Impact Hypothesis)](_URL_3_) which is coincident with the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary suggesting that a large impact occurred at this time. There would have been a lot of potential effects of this massive impact. Dust in the air reducing solar energy is a big one, not to mention the massive tsunamis which would have been generated and done a decent amount of damage (which there is also some geologic evidence of).\\n\\nThe other theory that is floating around that you alluded to is the eruption of the [Deccan Traps](_URL_1_), basically a massive flood basalt province in India. Here the theory goes that in addition to ash and other particulates, volcanic gases like carbon dioxide may have had dramatic effects on the climate, causing the mass extinction. There is some question as to whether these happen quickly enough to produce a violent enough effect to have caused a mass extinction, but on the basis of the amount of material extruded and the amount of gas which would have come with that material, a big change in the climate is not hard to imagine.\\n\\nAnother interesting hypothesis is that of a massive regression (lowering of sea level) that may have caused severe ecological upheaval leading to the mass extinction (see the link with the iridium anomaly and scroll down to \"Maastrichtian sea-level regression\"). \\n\\nThe short version is that we still don\\'t know exactly, maybe one of these, maybe all three, maybe some other. It\\'s often difficult to tie a particular cause to an extinction (hence why there is so much focus on what types of organisms died out, because this is usually our biggest clue as to what type of trigger may have caused the extinction). A lot also hinges on the exact dating of both the event and the beginning of the extinction, and in detail the dates for all of these have migrated a small amount over the years, favoring some hypotheses for a while until a new date comes out. \\n\\nIf you start looking into other mass extinctions, you\\'ll find a similar situation in terms of uncertain driving mechanisms and many similar players (big impact, flood basalt eruption, etc). The dinosaurs are the mass extinction which gets the most popular attention, but I\\'ve always been more fascinated by the [end Permian](_URL_0_) where nearly everything in the ocean was wiped out along with huge extinctions on land and a massive recovery time (several million years) for biodiversity to begin to return to pre-extinction levels.

       "  'text': 'The difference between an open and closed Mobius band is the same as the difference between an open set and what mathematicians call the _closure_ of that set.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about the difference between an open disk and a closed disk, first. A closed disk of radius 1 centered at (0,0) is the set of all points (x,y) with x^2 + y^2  < =1.  (by \" < =\" I mean  less-than-or-equal-to), and an open disk is the set of points (x,y) so that x^2 + y^2  < 1. The open disk does not actually contain the boundary, but it does contain points arbitrarily close to the boundary. \\n\\nSo an open Mobius band doesn\\'t actually contain that one edge, just all the points that are next to it (and they can be infinitesimally close).\\n\\nNow, an important fact is that topologists (people who study this kind of stuff) don\\'t distinguish between open disks and the entire Euclidean plane. In fact, we don\\'t distinguish between any open n-dimensional ball and the n-dimensional Euclidean space. In more mathematical terms, we say that the open n-disk is _homeomorphic to_ R^n. \\n\\nLet\\'s look at the case n=1. An open 1-disk is just the interval of points (-1,1) -- all the real numbers between -1 and 1 but not including 1 and -1 themselves. Let x be a variable that takes values on this open interval. Then the function \\n\\nf(x)=1/(x+1) + 1/(x-1)\\n\\nsends every x in (-1,1) to a unique real number, and it\\'s a continuous function, and its range is, in fact, all real numbers. It\\'s important to note that the inverse of this function is also continuous. That\\'s what makes it a \"homeomorphism\", a fancy word for \"topologists are too dim to notice any difference between the domain and the range\". Notice that f(x) sends -1 to -infinity and 1 to infinity, but -1 and 1 aren\\'t actually included in the domain!\\n\\nYou can write down a similar function for any open n-dimensional ball to the n-dimensional real numbers.\\n\\nGoing back to the Mobius band. When you\\'re on the surface of the mobius strip, there\\'s two main directions you can go in, so it\\'s a 2-dimensional surface. If it\\'s closed, well, that means in one of the directions, parallel to the edge, you keep going forever and end up on the opposite side every once in a while. Go in the other directions, and you hit an edge. (Much like the Russian fairy tales where Ivan the idiot stands at a crossroads and a sign says \"go to the right, a dragon will eat you, go to the left, a witch will end you, go straight, and meet your doom. From which came the schoolyard joke, that Ivan stood for a long time in front of a sign that says \"go to the right, get hit in the head. Go to the left, get hit in the head. Go straight, get hit in the head,\" so he stands for a while, and then the hand of god comes down and hits him in the head and says \"well don\\'t just stand there, you idiot!\" but I digress.)\\n\\nOn an open Mobius band, one of those directions is the same -- you go around twice and end up where you started. But the other direction is now an _open_ interval, whereas before it was a closed interval. This means that, to us silly topologists, the Mobius band may as well be infinitely wide. \\n\\nHow do you picture this? The answer is, you don\\'t. But, how do you construct a Mobius band? You take a strip of paper, twist it once, and glue the ends together. Now, let\\'s talk a strip of paper that\\'s got one infinitely long dimension. You can picture this as the subset of R^2 that\\'s between the lines x=-1 and x=1, but the y-value can range over anything. The edges of this strip that you are gluing are exactly those two vertical lines: x=-1 and x=1. But you need to twist them before gluing them together. So if you draw a horizontal line inside your infinitely tall strip of paper, at, say, y=2, and follow it to the right, when it hits the edge x=1 it emerges from the other edge, but at y=-2, because the edges need to be flipped with respect to each other. So the two lines at y=2 and y=-2 look like they\\'re different lines, but once you\\'ve remembered that those two edges are actually glued together with a flip, they become the same line.\\n\\nIt\\'s important that you don\\'t try to visualize an infinitely tall Mobius band -- the fact is, it doesn\\'t fit into our 3-dimensional space, so you\\'ll just give yourself a headache. But you can picture this long strip of paper and remember that the edges are glued with a flip, and that\\'s almost as good. \\n\\nIn more technical terms, then open Mobius band is what we call a _non-compact_ space.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Logarithms are tricky in the complex plane. For instance, since we have 1 = e^(2pi i) = e^(4pi i) = e^(6pi i)=..., then taking logarithms would seem to suggest that 0 = 2pi i = 4pi i = 6pi i =... which obviously isn\\'t the case. The problem arises because you are starting at 1, with log(1)=0, and tracing along e^(it) for t=0 to t=2pi, taking logarithms is fine until we get to 2pi, where we find that e^(2pi i)=1 which means that log(1)=2pi i, but we already know that log(1)=0. Logarithms do not behave well on the complex plane and the key mistake in your derivation is that you\\'re treating the logarithm like a normal logarithm on the reals. A logarithm on the entire complex plane is not a well defined function.\\n\\nThe solution to this is to make it so that that you\\'re not allowed to go in a full circle around 0 in the complex plane. If you pick any ray beginning at 0 and extending out to infinity on the complex plane and declare that the logarithm is undefined on this ray, then you will have a well defined logarithm, as you can\\'t go a full circle around 0 anymore. This is called a \"Branch Cut\". If we choose the ray along the negative imaginary axis, then log(1)=0 and log(-1)=i pi and there\\'s no ambiguity, since you can\\'t increase your angle past 3pi/2.\\n\\nNow, we *can* fix it in a much more appealing way, but it is more abstract. If we start at 1=e^(0i), and trace around the unit circle via e^(it), then we\\'re good until we hit t=2pi. To fix this, we can imagine that instead of tracing around the circle in the complex plane, that we\\'re actually tracing around a spiral that\\'s elevating, like a spiral staircase. [See Here](_URL_0_). By the time you hit t=2pi, you\\'ve gone around one entire time but instead of  being where you started, you\\'re exactly one level above where you started. If you were to flatten the this spiral, then you would be at the starting point, but because it has extended upwards, we are no longer at the same point. In this way, we can keep track of things by what level they are on. For instance, e^(0i) is on the 0th floor, but e^(2pi i) is on the first floor. We can define a logarithm on this spiral by inputting a complex number *and* what floor its on. This would look like log(z,n), where z is a complex number and n is the floor. So log(1,0)=0, log(1,1)=2pi i, log(1,2)=4pi i etc. If you try to cut out an entire floor and flatten it, then you\\'ll end up with the complex plane that has a branch cut at where you cut the floor out. This is the most natural way to extend the logarithm using complex numbers.',\n",

These places are floodplains, swamps, estuaries, marine to name a few. Here it is the water flow that carries and deposits the dirt, carried from upriver / from catchment areas. \\n\\nFor upper limits, there is no hard rule. Because of Gravity - water flow carrying eroded material will flow downwards. This means that as an area becomes raised relative to the surrounding area, it will become more vulnerable to erosion.  \\n\\nSo generally you could say that the limit to depositional layering is tied with the height of the surrounding environment. The relief (height of the landscape) is always going to in a transition to match the surrounding environment. \\n\\n\\n**For the other end - how deep can the layering go**\\n\\nStarting with layers of sediment - dirt/mud/sand lying on the ground\\n\\n If you bury layers deep enough, they will undergo lithification - compacting layers through pressure, turning sediment layers into rock.

You will still be able to see the layers as part of the patterning in the rock, but it is now considered to be rock, rather than individual layers of deposited sediment. \\n\\n[Sedimentary Rock](_URL_1_) Fully conserved layering. This is where fossils are most commonly found. \\n\\nIf you continue to bury sedimentary rock, it will change under higher pressure and temperatures. With these changes, Sedimentary rock will start to change, over time. Here the chemistry of the rock will begin to alter, layers can begin to 'melt' - folding, compacting, bending, mixing.

The general rule is about 25°C per KM of depth. \\n\\n1 bar is roughly Atmospheric pressure. 1500 Bars of pressure is roughly 5-10km deep. \\n\\nIf the area is hotter (such as by nearby magma), it can compensate for lower pressure.

This is the absolute removal of any layering the rock will have. This limit is dependent on many things - the pressure/temperature conditions, the geology of the specific rock, geology of surrounding rocks, percentage of water content, and so on. \\n\\nGenerally, around 1000°C is the lower limit for melting into magma.

The vortices get bent perpendicular to the breaking wave and stretched back round the breaking wave as it passes over head. \\n\\nThis is a great study. Hard to sum up the research better than they do. \\n\\n > When an overturning jet projecting from the crest in a breaking wave rebounds from the free water surface ahead, the strain is locally intensiﬁed between the secondary jet and the primary spanwise vortex behind it. Apparent instability in the saddle region where the maximum stretch occurs almost instantaneously triggers a threedimensional velocity ﬁeld at the plunging point. Thus, the spanwise undulation of the vorticity, arising from re-orientation of perturbations in the primary vorticity, is ﬁrst ampliﬁed in the saddle-point ﬂow and leads to a wavy vortex loop. At the initial stage of the formation of the vortex loop, the spanwise undulation of vorticity produces a spanwise pressure gradient near the surface and wraps the surface around the vortex axis, to form a ﬁnger-shaped rebounding jet. A stretch-and-intensiﬁcation process in the vortex loop along the principal axis of strain causes normal perturbations to a braid layer, by self-induction between counter-rotating vorticities at the bends of the vortex loop. The continual stretching of the vortex loop in the braid organizes a rib structure, in which the vortex loop envelops the upper part of a new primary vortex produced by the next plunging jet to the bottom of the previous primary vortex behind it.\\n\\n > Continual deformation of the large-scale vortices and the production of new smallerscale vortices are caused by local strains intensiﬁed among the vortices, even after the breaking front has passed. While some of the vortices dissipate via a cascade (scaling-down) process in the shear ﬁeld until the next breaking event, the remainder are transported in the reverse ﬂow to the next wave breaking point and may trigger further instabilities, leading to a rather complex three-dimensional vortex structure. Thus, especially in the case of a plunging breaker in shallow water, a number of the large-scale vortices are packed within a shallow ﬂuid region between the descending free surface and the bottom after the wave passes, which causes a more complex evolution of the vortex structure in the locally intensiﬁed strains between the closely packed vortices.\\n\\n_URL_0_',\n",

       "  'text': 'The recent news said something rather different, actually - the pseudogap has been well-known to exist for quite some time.\\n\\nBefore we get to the pseudogap, I need to explain what a(n energy) gap is. In materials, electrons can occupy lots of different states with lots of different energies. However, in some cases, there are energies that have no states, that is, electrons cannot have those energies. If there is a range of such energies, then the system \"has a gap\" which encompasses those energies.\\n\\nFrom now on, we\\'re going to assume that there\\'s only one important gap.\\n\\nNow, there are lots of ways that you can get a gap. Generically, the crystal structure of a material causes gaps to appear. Why does this matter? In simple cases, if you fill up all the states below a gap and none above, this means that you have an electrical insulator - a small kick to an electron won\\'t be able to get it to reach an unoccupied state because it needs the energy to get across the gap. If you don\\'t fill up the states below the gap all the way, then the material is a metal, because there are empty states available whose energy is arbitrarily close to the energy of a filled state. We talk about this as there being a \"band\" of energies (the set of energies below the gap) which is either filled (insulator) or partially filled (metal).\\n\\nOne more thing before I get to the pseudogap. Another way to get a gap is to have superconductivity. One way to think about this is to start with a metal, with a partially filled band. Now start cooling the system down. This allows the effect of the electrons interacting with each other to become more important (actually it\\'s a little more involved than that, but that\\'s besides the point here). It\\'s possible for those interactions to create a new gap inside what used to be a band, and sometimes the way that this happens is by pairing up electrons and forming a superconductor. A superconductor is kind of strange, in that all the states below this new gap are filled and the ones above are empty, but it\\'s a perfect electrical conductor, which goes against what normally happens.\\n\\nNow, the pseudogap. In the materials superconductivity appears at the highest temperatures that we know of, something strange happens at temperatures between superconductivity and the \"normal\" metallic state. A gap starts to appear, but only certain electrons see the gap. More precisely, at a given energy, if we start from a normal metal and cool to the pseudogap, then states at that energy with certain momenta are gapped out (no longer allowed), but states at that energy with other momenta are not removed. This is extremely strange, and there is, to my knowledge, only one other example of anything that looks even vaguely like this (and the physics there is almost certainly completely unrelated).\\n\\nWhat causes the pseudogap to appear is still extremely controversial, but there are two main interpretations of how the pseudogap relates to superconductivity. One is that the pseudogap occurs because there is \"extra\" pairing as you cool down that *helps* superconductivity appear earlier. The other interpretation is that the pseudogap is actually the material trying to be a full-blown superconductor, but something else is *stopping* the electrons from pairing up.\\n\\nThe recent article you saw, if I\\'m thinking of the right one, was about a paper that claimed to have experimental evidence for the latter interpretation, that is, it claimed that the pseudogap interferes with superconductivity.\\n\\nWhy this matters: right now, the very highest temperature superconductor has to be cooled by liquid nitrogen. But if we didn\\'t have to cool superconductors at all, we could use them in everyday life, which would be fantastic because heat doesn\\'t get wasted when current runs through a superconductor. If the pseudogap is getting in the way of superconductivity, then we need to figure out how to get rid of it in order to raise the temperature at which these materials go superconducting.\\n\\nIf we had room temperature superconductors, you could imagine, for example, superconducting power lines which don\\'t waste any heat as they transfer power from the power plant to your house. If we were to get really lucky with materials issues, we could also imagine MRI machines (which use superconductors to create huge magnetic fields) that don\\'t require liquid helium to cool them, alleviating an enormous part of the demand for our increasingly-depleted reserves of helium.',\n",

The iodine is what causes the warm feeling and funny mouth taste. The warm feeling is caused by two main mechanisms. First, iodine causes very fast, widespread dilation of tiny blood vessels. The amount of blood flowing through the capillaries then briefly increases, causing a feeling of flushing and warmth. The total amount of blood flow change is pretty small, so not much else besides the flushed feeling happens. Second, iodine can directly activate certain types of temperature sensors, causing a \"fake\" sensation of warmth. \\n\\nThe funny taste is also caused by direct receptor activation, this time in the mouth and tongue. \\n\\nFun facts: \\n\\n1.

       "  'text': \"I was going to write a nice summary but then I found [this](_URL_0_) website and it honestly gives a fantastic description of the processes that occur following acute spinal cord injury.\\n\\nIn a nutshell though, your spinal cord is made up of the axons (think of them as your brain wires) connecting your muscles to your brain. When there's an injury, and the spinal cord is ruptured, these axons can be damaged or severed completely. This is a problem as they are not very good at growing back. The damage further causes the loss of myelin (think wire insulation that shields the electrical impulses travelling up the axons) so that nerve impulses don't travel well, or at all, along the spinal cord. There is then an inflammatory response that causes more damage, and the axons often just fire off impulses endlessly effectively killing nerve cells (excitotoxicity). Cells that usually support and wrap around the axons (glia and oligodendricytes) then start to form a scar at the injury site and may actively prevent axon regrowth. Blood vessels are also damaged, so parts of the spinal cord can die off due to lack of blood flow/blood pressure changes.\\n\\nThis all causes paralysis and loss of sensation because the axons that are cut, damaged or otherwise killed are responsible for carrying motor commands to your muscles and sensory information back. The reason it's often irreversible is this:\\n\\nImagine you get a fibre optic cable and cut a bit of it. You can imagine how hard it would be to reconnect that. Nerve fibres are much finer, numerous, and more delicate than that. It's impossible to manually reattach it. This is also because they aren't really individual wires so much as tubes filled with special fluid and proteins and cellular machinery. So once you break them open it all spills out and can kill the cell if it doesn't heal over. Once it's healed over, how do you stick it back together? We can't.\\n\\nIn really severe cases there's nothing to be done although the idea behind newer therapies (like stem cells) is to grow new nerves from the beginning to replace the severed or damaged ones. But it's the most insanely complicated wiring system imaginable - innumerable contacts from the brain through the spinal cord out to the exact right muscle or sensory cell and back again. We can't just put them in, we have to convince the body to act like it did when it first made them so it can connect everything properly. And that's really tricky to do in adults for a whole host of reasons.\\n\\nI'll stop here because this is getting a bit long, but I hope it gave you some of the info you were after.\",\n",

The wire happens to be two 6\" lengths of [22 AWG](_URL_0_), and is attached to the terminals of a 9 V (alkaline) battery.

Think of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as CO*_2_*, CH*_4_*, and N*_2_*O, which alter the energy balance of the earth's atmosphere/surface by absorbing radiation in the atmosphere and retaining it as heat. GHGs have different capacities for warming. One molecule of N*_2_*O is something like 300x more potent at warming than CO*_2_*.\\n\\n\\nAnthropogenic radiative forcing describes the effect of man-made factors on the earth's energy balance. The IPCC considers post-1750 as anthropogenic, which is when man-made emissions increased dramatically, although human activity likely played a small role in climate forcing before this date. A higher concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, compared to pre-industrial atmosphere, absorb more radiation and retain more heat, thus contribute to warming. \\n\\n\\nRadiative forcing is an estimation and typically calculated using atmospheric models. Other major factors (besides GHGs) which contribute to the energy budget and are taken into account include: deforestation (+) or reforestation (-), natural short-term events such as volcanism(-), and changing solar input (+). Anthropogenic radiative forcing is estimated ~2.83 W m^-2 (2011).\",\n",

If experiments require that some dimensionless constant have a value of 10^(-10), something seems fishy.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t necessarily mean something *is* fishy!

All of the particles in the Universe have a non-zero vacuum energy, and when you add those up, you should get a contribution to the energy of the Universe which causes its expansion to speed up. Sure enough, we look out there and the Universe is accelerating! The problem is that it\\'s not accelerating nearly as much as the vacuum energy would predict.\\n\\nBut this doesn\\'t have to be a problem. The equations of gravity are allowed to have a constant called the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant behaves in exactly the same way as these vacuum energies do. So why don\\'t we just choose the cosmological constant to have whatever value needed to cancel out the huge vacuum energy contribution, but leave enough to give the acceleration we observe?\\n\\nWe can, but it\\'s sketchy. Here\\'s why. The observed acceleration - vacuum energy + cosmological constant - is *10^120 times smaller* than the vacuum energy alone. So if we work in units where the vacuum energy is 1, then we need to pick the cosmological constant to be -0.99999... where the ... contain about 115 more 9\\'s! That\\'s fine tuning. It would be a huge coincidence if two seemingly unrelated physical quantities were the exact same to 120 decimal places, so this is a very clear sign that we have more work to do to figure out why the cosmological constant has the value that it does, or if there\\'s some other explanation.',\n",

The problem is, PCR amplifies the DNA exponentially- even cDNA that\\'s present in small amounts will be exponentially amplified by the time the PCR runs its course.  So the amount of DNA present after doing PCR won\\'t accurately represent how much cDNA was present before the PCR.  \\n\\nqPCR monitors the amount of double stranded DNA present in real time- after every PCR cycle.  The DNA won\\'t get amplified exponentially until a certain number of PCR cycles have elapsed, after which it will be amplified exponentially- this is called the \"threshold cycle\".  Samples that have a larger amount of cDNA in them to begin with have a lower threshold cycle than samples with less cDNA to begin with.  \\n\\nYou can prepare an internal standard by doing serial dilutions of DNA of known concentration and making a standard curve that relates fluorescence of a sample to DNA concentration.  You can use this standard curve to quantitate how much DNA was in your sample when it reached its threshold cycle.\\n\\nBy comparing expression of a gene you\\'re interested in to expression of a gene whose expression level stays constant (a \"housekeeping\" gene), you can monitor how a gene\\'s expression changes in different cell types, under different chemical conditions, or a multitude of other things.\\n\\nThere are also lots of other cool things you can do with qPCR like monitoring environmental samples for the proportion of certain species of microorganisms.

Certain types of rocks have layers, mostly people think of [sedimentary rocks](_URL_4_) in this case, which have ['bedding'](_URL_7_) that was formed during deposition, i.e. individual events that caused sediment to deposit or changes in the type of sediment being deposited leave behind clear changes in the grain size, grain shape, minerals, or all of the above. These layers are initially flat (or nearly flat, in some places they might be angled at a few degrees over large distance depending on how they are deposited). Other types of rocks have layers as well, [metaphoric rocks](_URL_3_), which are rocks that have experienced elevated temperatures, pressure, or both sufficient to cause some amount of recrystallization of minerals, can have layers (['foliation'](_URL_5_)), but these layers have been formed by preferential crystallization of minerals in orientations either parallel to a shearing force or perpendicular to a compressional force that the rock experienced. ([Igneous rocks](_URL_8_) can also have layering in some cases, but this is a little more rare and not relevant for the outcrop you've linked to). \\n\\nIf you have an undeformed sedimentary rock or a metamorphic rock that has experienced one deformation event (to form a foliation) you would expect the layering present to be largely planar (though not necessarily horizontal). When you have 'curvy' layers, this is most often due to [folding](_URL_6_). There are LOTs of styles and formation mechanisms for folds, but at the most basic level, folding is another response to deformation (at the introductory geology level, we usually think of folding as a result of compressional deformation, but you can get it in pretty much every style of deformation as there are local areas of compression that occur in broadly transform and extensional settings). As rocks experience more deformation events, you can have very complicated histories (e.g. folded original bedding, then a foliation from metamorphism at a different orientation, then another folding event that folds everything, etc etc).\\n\\nNow to your outcrop, from the picture it's safe to say that there is a fold (or a series of folds) but whether those folds are folding original bedding, a foliation, or some combination is hard to tell from a picture like this (this is why if you see geologists working, you'll see us looking at things at a variety of scales from standing back to get the overall geometry, like this photo, to having our noses against the outcrop to try to tell if layerings are a foliation or bedding). As best I can tell, you are looking at the side view of at least one fold with the [axial plane](_URL_1_) oriented roughly horizontal (axial plane might be inclined a bit 'into' the outcrop, again, would have to climb all over it to tell), the hinge is to the left side of the picture, and the hinge line (refer to the same diagram for both hinge and hinge line meaning) would be going into the outcrop (or coming out at you if you projected it).

       "  'text': \"The video shows a variant of the [harmonograph](_URL_3_) called a *Blackburn pendulum*. The general idea of a harmonograph is that of a pendulum that is allowed to oscillate *independently* in two orthogonal directions.\\n\\nA [classic harmonograph](_URL_4_) is an apparatus in which a pen or marker is held fixed and a canvas is swung underneath it, and so the pen traces out the path of the canvas. A [Blackburn pendulum](_URL_5_) is a variant of the harmonograph which more or less reverses the role of the pen and the canvas. The pen (or pitcher of sand) is allowed to swing and the canvas is held fixed. This is achieved by attaching the bob of the pendulum is attached to a Y-shaped string, which is attached to the ceiling. (See the given links for photographs.)\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe sand obviously allows us to see the curve traced out by the bob. So what's the deal with the pattern you see in the video?\\n\\nFirst consider a one-dimensional pendulum. If the amplitude (the maximum angular deviation of the pendulum from equilibrium) is small, then the period of the pendulum is independent of the amplitude, and, in fact, depends only on the length of the pendulum. If a simple pendulum is allowed to oscillate in one direction, then the angle of the pendulum follows simple harmonic motion:\\n\\n >  θ = θ*_0_* cos(at)\\n\\nwhere *a* is some constant called the angular frequency. Multiplying this equation by *L*, the length of the pendulum, and again invoking the small angle approximation, we find that the *x*-coordinate of the bob satisfies simple harmonic motion as well:\\n\\n >  x = x*_0_* cos(at)\\n\\nA Blackburn pendulum, however, is allowed to oscillate independently in two orthogonal directions. In other words, both the *x*- and the *y*-coordinates of the bob undergo simple harmonic motion. But since these oscillations are independent, they may be out of phase with one another and their frequencies may be different as well! (The frequency for such a pendulum is a bit more complicated than just some function of the length of the pendulum.) So the *x*- and *y*-coordinates generally satisfy the parametric equations\\n\\n >  x = x*_0_* cos(at + 𝛿)\\n\\n >  y = y*_0_* cos(bt)\\n\\nThe curve that is traced out is called a *Lissajous curve*. [Here is an example](_URL_2_) of such a curve. [Here is another](_URL_0_), in which the curve closes, i.e., the curve comes back to its original point and then retraces the same curve repeatedly. [Here is another](_URL_7_), in which the curve does not close, i.e., the the curve does not retrace itself.\\n\\nA given Lissajous curve is bounded by some rectangle, whose dimensions are determined by the amplitudes x*_0_* and y*_0_*. The ratio *a*/*b* is the primary determinant of what the curve actually looks like. For instance, if *a*/*b* = 1, then the curve is actually an ellipse (which includes both circles and line segments as degenerate cases). If *a*/*b* = 2 and 𝛿 = π/4, the curve is a segment of a parabola. The curve is closed if and only if *a*/*b* is rational.\\n\\nSo what exactly is seen in the video? From inspection, it seems that x*_0_*/y*_0_* = 1, *a*/*b* is very close to 1 but not quite (maybe about 16/15 by counting the loops), and 𝛿 = π/2. [Here is a graph](_URL_1_) of the Lissajous curve with those parameters.\\n\\nBut wait! That's not all. All of what I have described so far neglects dampening effects like air resistance or internal friction. For a real pendulum, the amplitude decays over time. Such dampening can be approximated by a simple exponential factor.

When making the stock solutions the formulator chilled all the glassware to prevent volatilization of the compound and carefully weighed them out on a balance. The stock solutions were then diluted using volumetric flasks until they were the desired concentrations. Generally you don't want to do more than three or so serial dilutions because you can end up with large inherent errors. Then the formulator will run a validation test, GC/ms in our case, to verify that all of the compounds were there and that there wasn't contamination. The formulator would then provide us with certificates of composition with the calculated concentrations and their associated inherent error. Some solutions can be titrated of quantified with other analytical techniques and then the formulator would give a certificate of analysis.

       "  'text': 'Your question is a little open-ended. Usually, CompSci majors will spend a semester working with the math that defines these languages. In addition say \"I don\\'t quite understand\" doesn\\'t really give me a guide as to what you didn\\'t understand. However, let me take a stab at the basics:\\n\\nChomsky\\'s hierarchy of languages actually describes a hierarchy of mathematical objects. These objects can be expressed in terms of machines of a certain \"power\", grammars with ever more general parsing mechanism, or sets of (sequences) lists of symbols of ever greater complexity (or subtlety). I think Chomsky might label his hierarchy from Type 1, rather than Type 0, but it doesn\\'t really matter.\\n\\nThe most class is Type 0, which are recursively enumerable. In order to \"process\" (recognize) strings that belong to this language you need a machine that is Turing Complete. An idealized form of your computer is Turing Complete.\\n\\nThe next class down is Type 1, or the \\'context sensitive\\' languages. In this case \\'context sensitive\\' is a very technical term that refers to the way rules are processed with respect to a grammar --- it has nothing to do with  the popular notion of \"context sensitivity\" which we would call \"domain dependence\" or some such term. Context sensitive languages are not as powerful as recursively enumerable languages, but are boorishly difficult to work with, and are thus not studied at the undergraduate level very often. There are important examples of context sensitive languages, though.\\n\\nThe next class is Type 2, or the \\'context free\\' languages. Such languages are producable by a grammar which follows much more restricted set of rules. The context free languages are studied a great deal by undergraduates as they map well to the set of easily taught parsing technologies that are often used. In general, most problems are what I would call \"just context free\", ie, mostly Type 3 (regular), but need \"just a touch\" of Type 2. Most (computer) language designers prefer Type 2 languages, but actual practice makes this unlikely.\\n\\nThe weakest class is Type 3, or the \\'regular\\' languages. Regular languages are perhaps the most common languages; anyone who uses a computer uses \\'regular\\' languages on a daily basis. This is because many \"searching\" technologies are implemented as regular recognizers.\\n\\nThe next thing to discuss is what we *mean* by a language. In the formal analysis of languages, we prefer (to start with) to map languages to a specific mathematical object. The wiki article is actually quite good in this, but just to give you a little bit of leverage on the jargon: a language is a set (a group of things where no two elements are repeated) of strings (lists or sequences) of symbols (letters). One of the symbols you can include is \"space\" so that we can build strings that *look like*, for instance, English. We usually begin by considering *every possible string of symbols of any [finite] length* and call this something like Sigma-star (or some such thing). A specific language, then, is a subset of Sigma-star. For instance, one such language is the string that just consists of each symbol by itself. There\\'s all sorts of ways to define a subset of Sigma-star; most of them are \\'uninteresting\\' because they have no structure. However, if we allow certain specific (and useful) rules to be used in constructing a language, we can get languages that consist of more or less complex subsets of Sigma-star.',\n",

Stability at L4 and L5 is explained by gravitational equilibrium: if the object were moved into a tighter orbit, it would orbit faster which would counteract the increase in gravity; if the object moves into a wider orbit, the gravity is lower, but it loses speed. The net result is that the object appears constantly to hover or orbit around the L4 or L5 point.\\n\\nThe easiest way to understand the resulting stability is to say L1, L2, and L3 positions are as stable as a ball balanced on the tip of a wedge would be stable: any disturbance will toss it out of equilibrium. The L4, and L5 positions are stable as a ball at the bottom of a bowl would be stable: small perturbations will move it out of place, but it will drift back toward the center of the bowl.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"I do not think using one unit of energy would necessarily simplify the matter (sorry for the pun). Sometimes, using a specific unit of energy allows one to quickly gauge the relative energy of the system one is investigating. \\n\\nFor example, consider the unit of electron volts, which is equal to the energy change of an electron accelerated through a potential difference of one volt. When dealing with particles and their interactions, having the energy given in terms of eV makes relative particle energies immediately clear and makes it easy to determine how much energy it takes to break a given bond or induce another change. If one were designing an instrument for analyzing compounds (a mass spectrometer) with an electron impact ionization source, it's trivial to find the energy of the electrons at different voltages when the units are in eV, whereas otherwise, calculations are more involved. The order of magnitude is also convenient, since there are not excessive digits or decimal places. Obviously, when dealing with higher energy phenomena, eV is often inappropriate.\\n\\nAs another example, consider heating 1L of water by 1 degree Celsius. How much energy does this process take?  Using eV in this case would be very cumbersome, so instead units of calories would be easiest. Based on how the calorie is defined, the aforementioned heating simply takes 1000cal. Now consider work done by an electrical system. How much energy does a fully operating 50 watt solar panel provide per minute? Using the joule = watt x second relation, the answer is quickly found to be 3000J (or 3kJ). \\n\\nIf one were using this solar-derived energy to heat water, there is no perfect way to avoid conversions and make all calculations as trivial as before. However, while working with exclusively one type of process, using a specific unit allows easy comparisons and calculations. Returning to the electron example, an electron accelerated through 20 volts has an energy of 20eV. What if one wanted to use joules instead of eV for this measurement? Well, 20eV is about equal to 3.2 × 10^-18 joules. Clearly, using joules makes comparing energies significantly more challenging, and increases the likelyhood of calculation errors because of the unwieldy number of decimal places (which also necessitates scientific notation).\\n \\n*Edit: Fixed a few typos\",\n",

       "  'text': 'In some sense, they store that information in their current configuration.  Shape-memory is a fascinating property, but to understand what\\'s going on you need to know about how plastic deformation usually occurs in metals.\\n\\nOK: In metals, plastic (permanent) deformation occurs by the generation and motion of *dislocations*, flaws in the crystal lattice.  But let\\'s back up a step to explain what that means.  Bulk samples of metal are typically not one single crystal; they\\'re billions of tiny crystals (called grains) all jammed together. Metal forms into crystals because the crystal structure is what\\'s most energetically favorable, but in ordinary metal-production circumstances, the metal is cooled too quickly and too \"messily\" (meaning external vibrations and contaminants)  for the entire sample to form as one single crystal; instead, like I said, billions of little crystals form and eventually join each other to form the bulk sample.\\n\\nSo back to plastic deformation.  Plastic deformation, like I said, occurs through the generation and movement of dislocations.  Put enough stress on a sample of metal, and a) flaws start to appear in those tiny crystals as you distort them and b) those flaws, plus any pre-existing flaws that are left over from manufacturing, or caused by radiation knocking an atom out of the crystal, or whatever, start to move around.  Now, as they move around, the crystal moves with them.  Pass a dislocation through a cubic crystal, and you end up with a cube where the top half is shifted relative to the bottom half by one lattice unit, and that shift occurs one row of atoms at a time.  When plastic deformation occurs, in other words, you *permanently change the position of some atoms relative to other atoms*.  Pass enough dislocations through that cube I mentioned, and it will be cut in half - and that\\'s how you get metal to fail.\\n\\nNow, for most metals, under most conditions, plastic deformation is the only way you can cause big changes in the shape of the metal.  Elastic strain is reversible (let go of the part and it returns to its original configuration), but it doesn\\'t allow for much movement - one typical rule of thumb is that yield (the beginning of plastic deformation) occurs at a strain (change in length over original length) of 0.2%.  But you can often get plastic strains of ten times as much.\\n\\nShape-memory alloys, though, are weird.  Instead of deforming in the usual plastic way when you apply large strains to them, they\\'re able to deform in a special way called \"twinning\".  Twinning is much different from dislocation motion.  In twinning, you have two crystal lattices that mesh with each other, and join at special \"twin boundaries\" at particular angles.  Each side of the twin boundary can stay a perfect crystal, but it lets you change the shape of the crystal by offsetting one crystal half with respect to the other by the \"twin angle\".  And when twins are formed, they do so *quickly* - almost instantaneously, the whole half of the crystal sort of \"pops\" to its twin location from its original location.  Critically, twinning *preserves the crystal structure*.  Twinned crystals can turn back into their original crystals, because none of the atoms have changed in their relative *lattice* (not absolute) positions.  Give them enough thermal energy to smear out their positions a bit, and they pop back into their original crystal configuration (which is, after all, the more favorable configuration, or else it wouldn\\'t have originally formed).',\n",

Far away, the 'bends' in that curve average each other out, and you just get currents going left to right or right to left. I'm not a knitter, but if at the edge the knit doesn't double back on itself like in the plain weave, then you could conceivably have them all go the same direction, making an effective 'current sheet' going in one direction.

       "  'text': \"In GR, you have an immense freedom to choose your coordinate system and many quantities and physical phenomenon are described described differently depending on your coordinate system. For instance, suppose you are an observer far away from the black hole and are using so-called Schwarzschild coordinates to describe some non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. To you, all infalling particles never actually reach the horizon. They just slow down to a halt as they approach the horizon, and so the acceleration of all objects approaching the horizon *in this coordinate system* is zero!\\n\\nThat probably doesn't quite match the answer you expect. Since it becomes harder and harder to escape the pull of the black hole as you get closer, you should expect the acceleration to get larger. There *is* a way to describe that intuitive notion. Some background terms first. When a particle moves under gravity alone (the particle is said to be *free*), we say that the *proper acceleration* of that particle is zero. Or simply, the acceleration of the particle is zero. If a particle is subjected to non-gravitational forces, then the resulting proper acceleration is non-zero.\\n\\nSo the meaningful question to ask is the following: suppose a particle is falling into the black hole under gravity alone. Its proper acceleration is zero. If the particle (or spaceship or whatever) were to fire its rockets and fight against the pull of the black hole, it could accelerate hard enough so that it remains stationary according to the faraway observer. *What, then, is the proper acceleration needed to exactly counteract the geodesic motion into the black hole?* Well, there turns out to be a simple enough answer (although not quite trivial to derive). If the particle has Schwarzschild radial coordinate *r*, then the required proper acceleration needed is\\n\\n >  *a* = √[r / (r - r*_s_*)] GM/r^(2)\\n\\nwhere M = mass of black hole and r*_s_* = 2GM/c^(2) = Schwarzschild radius of the black hole. Note two important things:\\n\\n 1. If *r* is much larger than *r**_s_* (true for the exterior of a star or planet), we find that *a* = GM/r^(2), which is just the usual Newtonian formula for gravitational acceleration.\\n\\n 2. As *r* -- >  *r**_s_*, then *a* -- >  infinity. That is, for *any* black hole, the proper acceleration required to counteract the gravity gets arbitrarily large as you approach the event horizon. In other words, if you were to successfully escape the pull of a black hole while just outside the horizon, you would feel an *incredible* amount of *g*'s and that's quite an understatement.\",\n",

If no heat is input into the system the capillary flow will halt, and no output energy will be produced. \\n\\nUnfortunately, from an engineering point of view, this design is flawed.

       "  'text': 'It\\'s the subconscious part of the brain. As a rule we\\'re aware of only a small part of what our brain does.\\n\\nYou\\'re basically talking about volitional movement, which is intimately tied up to some of the biggest mysteries of the brain, things like will, consciousness, self-awareness.\\n\\nA rather academic but interesting paper, titled [\"Volitional Control of Movement: The Physiology of Free Will\"](_URL_0_)\\n\\nThat paper suggests that the movement comes first, and the sense that it is voluntary comes second. \\n\\nMy own opinion is that two main ideas are involved.\\n\\nThe first is that awareness itself is basically a dynamic symbolic map of everything we know. It\\'s an ever-changing map of intricately connected symbols, each symbol representing what we \"know\". This is what consciousness is. And the symbols themselves can be composed of other symbols. Self-awareness can then be explained as a subset of this symbolic map, containing the symbol \"I\", which represents everything we are aware of about ourselves; all the senses we are aware of; emotions, whether we\\'re hot or cold, hungry or full, or thirsty.\\n\\nIt very neatly explains why there is a subconscious and the phenomena of the voice in our head, our \"thoughts\". Implication is the brain has many thoughts we have no awareness of because they aren\\'t represented on our symbolic map in our heads.\\n\\nAnother interesting concept is that self-awareness itself is basically a sensory organ--it senses part of what is going on in our brain. We can sense our emotions, sense our thoughts, sense our imaginations. \\n\\nI knew a guy once who wasn\\'t able to sense his emotions. He had them. You could see it in his behavior; he would act angry, or happy, or sad. But if you asked him what emotion he was feeling, he would say \"none\". He was not able to sense his own emotions. Those symbols (and the emotion sensors) were missing from his internal symbolic map.\\n\\nThe second main idea is of feedback control systems. Also known as \"closed loop feedback systems\". Goals are intimately tied up with this.\\n\\nA good example of a very simple feedback control system is an ordinary thermostat. It has a goal input--the temperature you set it at. Also known as the reference signal. It has an output, a signal that turns the furnace off or on. It has a feedback signal--the actual room temperature, which tells you what the furnace is doing.\\n\\nHow does a thermostat \"know\" when to turn the furnace off or on? It compares the feedback signal with the reference signal. If too warm, it turns off the furnace. If too cold, it turns on the furnace.\\n\\nAll known animals are basically complex assemblies of feedback control systems. It is inherently highly responsive and flexible, and handles error extremely well.\\n\\nA thought experiment--or you can try this in real life. Put an object on a surface within arm\\'s reach, then grab it. Lights are on, your eyes can see the object, it\\'s quick and your hand goes right to it.\\n\\nNow try the same thing with a blindfold on, or in pitch darkness. Same object, arm\\'s reach. Now grab it. Notice how differently you arm moves this time? That groping movement? You no longer know exactly where the object is, you have to feel around for it. You can sense where your fingers, hands and arm is--that\\'s your kinaesthetic sense. But you can\\'t tell where the object is until you touch it. Once you touch it, grabbing  it is a snap. That\\'s feedback.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s a complex set of coordinated systems involved in making it work, and it is largely subconscious. You\\'re not really aware of how your arm is moving, all the many muscles involved. You\\'re just aware of what your arm is doing, and your goal of grabbing the object.\\n\\nNote, how the goal itself is a perception. It\\'s a perception of a DESIRED perception. We desire to perceive the sensation of the object in our hand.\\n\\nThe beauty of feedback is how it adapts and responds so quickly and easily to error and perturbation. In fact, in a sense, it is error that motivates behavior. Error being the difference between present perceived state and desired perceived state. If we had no goals, we would have no behavior.\\n\\nThis is how all those balancing robots work.\\n\\n[Video of a pole-balancing quadcopter robot.](_URL_3_)\\n \\n[Video of a pencil-balancer robot.](_URL_2_)\\n\\n[Webpage on how the pencil-balancer robot works.](_URL_1_)',\n",

(There are other kinds of anomalies which are more mundane and are just a feature rather than a bug).\\n\\nHowever, each particle you add to the theory will make some contribution to this gauge anomaly which depends on the charge of the particle under the fundamental forces (strong, weak, E & M).

Interestingly, the most important frequencies in these sounds that contribute to the perception of \"roughness\" are around 2-4 kHz. They suggest one possible explanation: these frequencies correspond to resonant frequencies of our ear canals, so we are very sensitive to these sounds. Thus, we might find these sounds aversive so we avoid these sounds in order to protect our hearing.\\n\\nHowever, there are other factors. We are more likely to find the sound of nails on a chalkboard \"rough\" if the sound is accompanied by the image, so the perception is context-dependent. Also, the perception might be culturally-dependent.

A chemical engineer would need to do this sort of calculation before specifying tank materials/dimensions in a chemical plant. However, getting the answer is going to be complicated.\\n\\nThe ideal gas law cannot be used to predict supercritical fluid properties. However, you can use a more general relationship called an equation of state (EoS). The ideal gas law is a special equation of state in which all variables are linearly related to each other. Under more exotic conditions, you have to start adding polynomial terms and/or variables related to the size, shape, and interatomic forces of the molecules themselves. One commonly-used general EoS is the [Peng-Robinson Equation](_URL_0_), which uses the familiar P, V, and T along with several other constants that have been measured and tabulated for a wide variety of substances. It's accuracy varies depending on the substance and pressure/temperature you're looking at, but it'll usually get you close.\\n\\nFor common molecules like propane, there are also substance-specific EoSs, which are much more accurate but often behind paywalls. However, [here is a non-paywalled paper with an EoS for propane](_URL_1_). Unfortunately, it's so complex that it's really only useful for computer simulations, not doing a calculation by hand.\\n\\nThere are some hidden factors in your question as well, like 1. what are the starting pressure and temperature of propane in the tank, and 2. how quickly is heat being transferred/dissipated from the fire to the tank? Introducing heat transfer complicates things immensely, and you start having to make assumptions about what your system is doing. Also, the propane in a commercial tank is actually partially liquified, meaning that you're starting from a two-phase mixture, which also complicates things.\\n\\nIn order to solve this, you would assume that the fire is an unlimited source of heat, and that the heating is an isochoric process (constant volume, which is appropriate for a sealed tank like this). You can pick an EoS of your choice and set f(P1,V1,T1)=f(P2,V2,T2). Since V1=V2, the equation will simplify to f(P1,T1)=f(P2,T2). A typical commercial propane tank is under [4bar pressure at 30C](_URL_2_), which gives you T1 and P1, but because there is both liquid and vapor in the tank, you would need to know the total volume of both, and first calculate the pressure (P1b) that would be evolved once the critical temperature (T1b) is reached. After that, you can set f(P1b, T1b)=f(P2,T2), where T2 is the weakening point of steel (~700K), and solve for P2. If this value is much larger than the burst rating, then the tank will burst before the steel weakens, and vice versa.\\n\\nI don't have time to do the calculation at this exact moment, but you can do it yourself, or someone else can come along and do it. Notice that the answer will probably depend on how full/empty the tank is when the fire occurs. My gut feeling is that a mostly-empty tank will exceed the weakening temperature before bursting, while a mostly-full tank will burst long before that. I could be wrong, though!\",\n",

The SA node has specialized cells that ‘leak’ ions and once the membrane potential reaches a critical point an action potential propagates. From the SA node the signal travels through the atria, where it then reaches the AV node. The AV node causes a small delay in the signal transmission to allow for blood to flow from the atria to the ventricles. The AV node then sends the signal through the Purkinje fibers which stimulates a coordinated ventricular contraction. \\n\\nThere are factors that can affect rate and strength of contractility in the heart. First is vagal tone from the parasympathetic nervous system. This decreases rate and contractility by acting directly on the SA node. Some drugs, like some blood pressure medications can have an effect on the AV node as well, increasing delay time or blocking conduction completely. Input from the sympathetic nervous system in the form of circulating catecholamines have the opposite effect, increasing heart rate and contractility. Sympathominetic drugs like atropine and cocaine also can have this effect. \\n\\nFurthermore, the heart follows Starlings law, in which increased preload (stretch by returning blood volume) of the ventricle in diastole causes increased contractility in systole. The Starling curve of the heart shows increasing contractility from increased preload up to a point, after which the myocardium fails and contractility drops precipitously. Preload (stretch) and afterload (vascular resistance) affect cardiac output and are often targets for therapies to improve cardiac function. \\n\\nAlso, there can sometimes be aberrant conduction pathways which can lead to arrhythmias. \\n\\nCardiac physiology and electrophysiology is quite complex, and I cannot do it justice in a Reddit comment, but this is a start.

Domains and certificates.\\n\\nThe url has several parts, the most relevant here is the domain in the middle (e.g. _URL_1_ or _URL_0_). Your browser looks up the IP address by talking to a DNS server. That DNS server then consults a root DNS server to look up the registration information for that domain. Then it contacts the DNS server the root server told it to talk to and asks it for IP address (most of this information ends up being cached for later use). Then, the browser contacts that IP address directly and sends the web server there (if there is one) the URL to handle and return html for.\\n\\nIf someone (say your ISP or whomever) had control over your DNS settings or your networking they could totally interfere with these operations (with a \"man in the middle\" attack). And, indeed, sometimes precisely this is done for good reasons. For example, you might connect to hotel wifi and then attempt to go to some web page but get redirected to a landing page that forces you to enter some login information before allowing you to use the connection normally. But you don\\'t want it to be possible for anyone to deceive you, and that\\'s where https and certificates come in.\\n\\nYour browser will be loaded with a set of cryptographic certificates. When you connect to a site via https you do all of the steps described above along with a key exchange and certificate handshake with the server. The server presents to you a certificate that contains a public key that\\'s been digitally signed by a certificate authority. There will be a cryptographic chain of trust between the root certs you have installed in your browser, the CA company that signed the web site\\'s keys, and the site\\'s certificate presenting proof of that signing. There\\'s no way to forge such a signature without someone having access to the CA\\'s (certificate authority) private key. The browser and the site communicate via an encrypted channel by sharing each other\\'s public keys using RSA public/private key encryption during this handshake. Once your browser confirms that the server it\\'s talking to is in fact the real deal it will continue the connection and exchange a simpler set of encryption secrets so that the browser and server can continue to share an encrypted connection without having to use the more costly RSA algorithm. Then the rest of the interaction occurs over an encrypted connection as the browser sends the URL and other data and the server replies with html etc. If the handshake does not finish successfully and the browser can\\'t verify the site is who they say they are then the connection is terminated and the browser will pop up a dialog telling the user what happened, etc. It\\'s not a foolproof solution but it protects against a lot of the easiest man-in-the-middle attacks (like DNS spoofing, traffic redirection, etc.)',\n",

Essentially left and right circularly polarized light has opposite angular momentum,  linearly polarized light is a superposition of the two. \\n\\nSisyphis cooling occurs due to the lattice created by the laser beams interference. Typically you have 6 beams at right angles to one another, created by reflecting 3 beams back on themselves, which reverses the circular polarisation.  This create an electric field that is a standing wave with periodic maxima and minima called an optical lattice.  The potential energy of an excited atom increases/decreases (depending on whether the mf quantum number is positive / negative) when it reaches the maxima due to the stokes shift.  As such an atom in a positive mf state well slow down when it heads towards a maximum.  However,  when it reaches a maximum there is an increased chance it undergoes a transition to the negative mf state (via a transition to a J =3/2 state) which them puts it at a low potential energy state.

       "  'text': 'Measurement and observation are typically used interchangeably, with measurement being the more common term. Measurement of a quantum state will cause the state to [collapse](_URL_2_) to one of the eigenstates of the observable (physical property) being measured. For example, if you have an electron that is in a superposition of spin states 1/sqrt2 \\\\* (|up >  + |down > ), you will measure either spin-up or spin-down with equal probability. This works for continuous observables too: if you measure the position of a [particle in a box](_URL_4_), you will get a random position, with the likelihood of each position being proportional to the square of the wavefunction at that point. \\n\\nThe mechanism behind how and why wavefunctions collapse is not very well understood. The most popular interpretation is the [Cophenhagen interpretation](_URL_0_), which I have described here, but other interpretations are that [measurement results in parallel realities](_URL_1_), or that wavefunction collapse could simply be a [spontaneous process which is catalyzed](_URL_3_) by interaction with a macroscopic object.\\n\\n > More specifically, what do they mean in the context of the uncertainty principle, double slit experiment, or entangled particles?\\n\\n* **Relationship to uncertainty principle**: you cannot measure two non-commuting observables (such as position / momentum, or energy / time) simultaneously to arbitrary precision. Intuitively, this is because information about one requires an absence of information about the other. For example, in the case of position/wavelength, if you consider a wave pulse propagating on a string, you can\\'t simultaneously have a well-defined position to the wave and a wavelength, since a perfectly defined position is just an infinitely thin wave, which contains a mixture of all possible wavelengths, and a perfectly defined wavelength is a sine wave, which doesn\\'t have a well-defined position.\\n* **Relationship to double slit experiment**: by passing the photon/electron/other particle through the two slits, the quantum state is in a superposition of passing through the first slit and second slit. These two possible paths will interfere with each other to create the fringe pattern that the experiment is famous for. When you measure the particles\\' positions, the interference manifests by making the particles unlikely to occupy the space between the fringes.\\n* **Relationship to entanglement**: you can prepare a multi-particle state which is \"entangled\", meaning that the state as a whole exhibits instantaneous, nonlocal correlations which cannot be described fully by looking at either particle alone. Consider preparing a pair of electrons A and B in a superposition of spin states: |AB >  = 1/sqrt2 ( |up,  up >  + |down, down >  ). You give electron A to Alice, and B to Bob, who travels to the other side of the galaxy. If Alice decides to measure her electron\\'s spin and receives spin-up as the result, then instantaneously (regardless of distance), Bob is guaranteed to receive spin-up as his result once he measures his particle. Note that although this is instantaneous, *this does not allow Alice to send a message to Bob faster than light*, since she cannot control how the state collapses, and Bob cannot tell if Alice has measured her particle already. They are guaranteed to receive the same result, but they need to travel (subluminally) to each other to compare their answers.',\n",

The force would be put onto the person due to air rushing out the door into the vacuum of space.

In this case, it has the potential to be non-negligible. I haven't yet seen the movie, but assuming they arent near a very massive object like a star, the air pressure force should be the only force that acts on them, which means that they should continue floating in the line that they left the air lock, basically until they hit something. The basic principle of forces is that an object that is moving, will keep moving along a straight line, until acted upon by another force.\\n\\nAs for how much would be exerted, that depends a lot on the specific parameters of the room, and the pressure difference, the outflow rate, and the cross sectional area of the people.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Someone asked the [same question a few days ago](_URL_2_), so if I may I'll just copy my answer to them:\\n\\n >  Stone tools aren't just ordinary rocks that hominids picked up to bash things. They're a technology made by a distinctive process called lithic reduction. Basically, you take a large stone (some rocks, like flint, work better than others – that could be your first clue that what your holding is an artefact) and hit it with another rock to shear off a flake. Repeat this a few times and you have two useful products: any number of sharp flakes, and the original rock itself, which can be shaped into any number of useful forms.\\n > \\n >  There aren't many natural processes that would do that. So if you find those signature flakes or cores there's a good chance they were made by humans. This find from Turkey isn't the best example, since there's only one flake (so far). Finding multiple flakes or shaped cores together would be more of a smoking gun. In that case you'd probably be looking at a butchery site or camp, so there's a good chance there'd also be other evidence pointing to human activity: animal bones with cut marks, human bones, etc.\\n > \\n >  >  How clear cut is an isolated collection of shards? If a piece of flint tumbles down a hill and shatters, how different does that look from something that was deliberately knapped?\\n > \\n >  Not a great deal different. That is a difficulty with very old finds like this (later on you're more likely to see specific tool forms, retouching, and other tell-tale signs). But they are distinguishable to the expert eye. There a subtle features on the surface of a flake struck off by a human hand that you're very unlikely to see on natural flakes shattered by erosion, and you can also look at the environment the artefact was found in to see if it's likely you'd find naturally shattered flint there. In the case of this find from Turkey they had both lines of evidence. I'll just quote the relevant section of the paper^* in full:\\n > \\n >  >  The artefact (inferred to be a hard hammer product) has a **visible striking platform** and a clearly-developed **bulb of percussion** with minor stress fissuring on the proximal ventral surface (Fig. 4a). There is evidence for at least two **prior removals** on the dorsal surface, including one flake scar terminating in a hinge fracture (Fig. 4b). The presence of at least two removals makes it highly unlikely that this results from natural processes. Although the gravels of U1, along with those from the higher terrace sequence, contain large quartzitic clasts, these tend to display flat fractures and despite the counting and identification of thousands of clasts from these and similarly-derived gravels, we have **not observed any comparable clasts** within the Lower Pleistocene sequence. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that flake-mimicking humanly-struck material can only be convincingly generated in high energy environments e.g. beaches (Bridgland et al., 1997). **None of the sediments in this sequence represent high energy transport**. Even the overlying slope sediment, which is composed almost entirely of basalt, results from depositional processes associated with low angle slides along weak shallow failure planes within the underlying Miocene Ahmetler Formation, together with less abrupt low energy mass movements. Thus, the occurrence of this flake within the fine-grained alluvial sequence is distinctive and unusual and its form is highly unlikely to have resulted from natural erosion processes.\\n > \\n >  [And here's the figure they refer to.](_URL_0_)\\n > \\n >  I've emphasised the key pieces of evidence for it being an artificial flake:\\n > \\n >  * **Visible striking platform** – getting predictably shaped flakes from the rough natural surface of a rock is hard, so flintknappers usually started by splitting the core in half to get a flat *platform* to work off. A bit of that flat surface is left at the top of the flake.\\n > \\n >  * **Bulb of percussion** – in the picture in the left you can quite clearly see a lump at the top of the flake where the hammerstone hit it, with little ripples radiating out from it.\\n > \\n >  * **Prior removals** – this wasn't the first flake struck off from the original core; the picture on the right shows two indentations where other flakes were detached beforehand.\\n > \\n >  * **Not observed any comparable clasts** – the authors note that while there is a lot of shattered rock in the area, they've done their due diligence and haven't found similar fracture patterns on any of them, meaning this one is unlikely to have been produced by the same (presumably natural) processes.\\n > \\n >  * **None of the sediments in this sequence represent high energy transport** – humans hit hard with concentrated force to produce flakes, so you'd have to be in an environment where rocks were getting bashed around a *lot* to find something that would look similar (the authors give the example of a beach, your example of a rock tumbling down a very steep slope could conceivably manage it too). This doesn't look to be such an environment.\\n > \\n >  So although this is a very tricky identification – a single flake in very old sediment – the authors do make a convincing case for it being artificial.\\n > \\n >  -----\\n > \\n >  ^* Maddy et al.

There have been no archaeological or genetic studies. The Onge could apparently not understand the Sentinelese language when they were working with scientists in ontacting the tribe in the 1990s. This would suggest that the Sentinelese have been isolated for long enough to develop a mutually unintelligible language from those spoken on the other Isands in the archipelago but there is no study done on the Sentinelese language either.\",\n",

The use of similar tokens have been used for years by companies to authenticate things such as remote users.\\n\\nThe RSA tokens are the most commonly used ones, and you can see them working so I will explain based on those, then expand to the likely operation of the HSBC ones. The operation is a secret and I cannot say for sure which system it uses, but I will explain the RSA system, then explain another system it could possibly be using.\\n\\nAn RSA token is a keyring. It has numbers on it that change every 60 seconds. A user uses the code as a password to log into a server, and I commonly see them used by people who work from home to VPN into the company. The user uses it by typing a 4 digit pin number in as a password, followed by the number on the token. The server uses the same set of mathematical equasions, and the same timing to know what the number was at the time and authenticate the user. If someone evesdropping takes the password used, the password changes a minute later so it is useless to them. If someone steals the token then they won't know the pin so it is still useless for breaking into the system it is used to authenticate again. \\n\\nThe HSBC system is likely the same only the pin code is entered into the token itself rather than entered as the start of the password, and rather than having constantly changing numbers on the token, it only displays the number for that time. The server can still know what this number will be so authenticates. \\n\\nThere is another way it could work. This is the method commonly used by things like car alarm remotes. Rather than being based on time, it could possibly be based on order. If the token generates a code, and the next time generates a new code as part of a sequence rather than based on a clock. The server knows the same sequence but will accept one of the next hundred codes as an authentication rather than the very next code. This allows for people generating a code and not using it, or in the case of car alarm remotes, people pressing the button in their pocket when not near the car. The probability of guessing what one of those next hundred codes is will be very small as it is a 6 digit code, and repeated entries of an incorrect code will lock the account anyway.\\n\\nWith either system, it is secure because if you steal the token you do not know the pin, thus it is useless. If you evesdrop the code, the code constantly changes so it is also useless. Someone needs to get the pin, and steal the token to break in which is the same level of security as a bank card anyway, and is quite hard to do, save for countries still using magnetic stripes for bank cards (America I'm looking at you, upgrade to chip and pin already...)\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I haven't read a lot of the research on team sports in particular but my reading on in-groups would suggest that the initial decision to support a team is somewhat arbitrary (parents support them, location, player you like etc.) but in-group biases maintain and bolster that support. One of the first really field-changing studies on in-group bias was done at a series of camps for your kids (I think all boys), set up to look at how groups interact. They put the kids into different groups to see how they would see the members of their own groups and others. They found that even if you **show all the participants that which group they are placed in is completely arbitrary** (From memory, they showed all the kids a drawing out of a hat to pick groups) they will still show strong biases towards their team members and against the other team. The evolutionary basis for this is obvious. It makes a lot of sense for us to be hard-wired to stick within our group and believe it to be right/smarter/stronger and see other, potentially threatening groups, as wrong/dumber/weaker. \\n\\nThe other element I'd throw into the mix is that of sunk cost. A team you've supported over the years has seen considerable emotional investment from you. People are notoriously bad at giving up things they've already invested in, even if it is practical/logical to do so (like supporting a local team). \\n\\nLastly, consider cognitive dissonance. If you're not aware, it's basically the idea that we unconsciously chance our perception of dissonant factors so that there is no incongruity. For example, I like X band but you don't. They make a new song that is widely considered to be neither good or bad. I'm *likely* to see the song as good because I unconsciously want it to fit with my previously held beliefs. Conversely, you are *likely* to see it bad for the same reasons. The same effect could be applied to supporting a sporting team. Ever wonder why both team's supporters think the referees are against *their* team? That's cognitive dissonance. We apply all sorts of unconscious adjustments to our perceptions, in order to maintain our view.   \\n\\nSo, my answer to you is that the team itself is largely irrelevant. Once you *start* supporting a team, there are a lot of psychological forces that hold that belief in place.\",\n",

In ice water, each molecule is rigid enough to form more H bonds, which forms a lattice that pushes the molecules farther apart, making it less dense. As liquid water gets colder, it acts just like any other nonpolar liquid in that it gets more dense as it gets colder. At 4C, the water has maximum density because it is as cold as it can get before it starts forming rigid lattices.',\n",

This is a good approximation for some things, but is not quite the case in reality. In a dilute solution, water has a lot of degrees of freedom as it forms a very lose structure through hydrogen bonding between the water molecules. Almost all hydrogen bonds are thus water-water. At physiological temperature and pressure, the individual molecules break and reform the hydrogen bonds often as they rotate and translate around the solution.\\n\\nNow, if we take the reality of what biology looks like, it turns out that there is a lot more stuff floating around. Proteins, small molecules, DNA, and all the other stuff make for a pretty crowded environment. Water is excluded from a lot of the volume by minimizing hydrophobic surfaces. When the number of other molecules grows, the number of water-water interactions becomes smaller compared to water-other molecule interactions. This can lead to cases where water molecules are hydrogen bonding primarily to other molecules either in isolation or as a chain. Since the other molecules are typically larger (protein or DNA), they are a lot less flexible and can create a local energy minimum trapping the water molecules in the state of bonding. This is what is referred to as \"ordered water\". The water is essentially an extension of the molecule and does not have as many degrees of freedom as \"free water\" in solution. \\n\\nThe timescales of exchange of these ordered water molecules depends a lot on the environment. You should have no trouble finding articles. [This recent article](_URL_0_) for example, measured the exchange rate for a single protein with 4 buried waters to be between 0.1 and 200 us depending on the molecule. However, this is just the exchange rate, on average, the water molecule is always present in the same conformation with the rest of the protein.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Do you have something specific in mind when you say \"Transfer of Training\"? The only thing that comes to mind is transfer in learning, which is the idea that we can transfer knowledge to other similar (near transfer) or dissimilar (far transfer) domains. Another way of saying this: near transfer is solving a similar problem in a similar context, far transfer is a different, but related problem, or solving a problem in a different context.\\n\\nA low-level perceptual learning example: if you train an observer to discriminate between lines at different orientation in a particular part of the visual field, the training does not transfer to other retinal locations (or to the other eye if you trained only a single eye). The thought was that you are changing the response / tuning properties of a small set of neurons in your visual cortex that respond to stimulation in just a small part of your visual field and not any other neurons that code for other locations. However, it turns out that if you train another, completely irrelevant task at another location, training will transfer from one location to the other ([Xiao et al. 2008](_URL_0_)). The idea is that during learning there are two things going on: learning about the feature (e.g. orientation) and learning about the location where that feature occurs (how to deal with noise in that place in the world). By training an irrelevant task in the second location, you have done this second kind of learning and there will be transfer. \\n\\nHere is a more abstract or higher-level example of transfer: there\\'s a classic study on analogical reasoning / transfer ([Gick and Holyoak, 1980](_URL_1_)  < -pdf) in which participants were presented with the following \"radiation\" problem (paraphrasing here the original problem from Dunker (1945)): you are a doctor trying to treat a patient who has some sort of stomach tumor. You want to irradiate the tumor using special rays, which, if they are strong enough, will destroy the tumor. However, if you use a ray at a high enough intensity to destroy the tumor, it will also destroy all of the healthy cells in its path. If you use a ray at a lower intensity, it won\\'t harm the cells, but it won\\'t destroy the tumor. How do you treat the patient? I think the spontaneous solve rate for this problem was very low (10-20%?) partly because it\\'s a little open-ended and the solution isn\\'t clear. However, if you present participants with an analogous problem first, they get better at solving this one. The analogous problem was something like: a general wants to attack a fort with his army. The fort is surrounded by a moat with bridges approaching it from several sides. The entire army cannot fit across one bridge -- they would be an easy target and a the bridge might collapse. Sending a smaller force that could fit across the bridge wouldn\\'t be strong enough to bridge the walls. How can the general take the fort? After solving this problem (which is easier and more intuitive), people were much better at solving the radiation problem. The reasoning is that these two problems share many structural features that make the transfer of a solution possible. If they solved a different problem with an unrelated structure, they couldn\\'t transfer their solution method to this problem.\\n\\nTransfer can be thought of as the critical kind of learning -- the ability to apply what we\\'ve learned to new situations.',\n",

Could be a few million years, could be a few billion ... this isn\\'t helping you date the \"tablet\" at all...\\n\\nWhat we seek is some way of estimating the date at which that piece of rock was picked up, transformed, and disposed of. There are a few direct methods which allow for that, such as [fission track dating](_URL_1_) and [Luminescence dating](_URL_3_). However not all geological materials are suited those methods, and you might be reluctant to partially destroy this hypothetical tablet to take the small sample required.\\n\\nSo, what then?\\n\\nWelp ... there might be secondary materials coating the tablet ... pigments, soot, lichen encrustations and several of those are amenable to direct geochronological methods such as  C^14 ; so there is that.\\n\\nOtherwise, you\\'ll need to pass by some indirect method to establish a correlation with something else which is directly dateable. The key to that usually passes by a fine understanding of the [stratigraphy](_URL_0_) within which the artefact was found. Somewhere within this stratigraphy might be materials, fossils, pollens or isotopic signatures which will allow you to either set an age for the specific horizon where the artifact was found, or to bracket that age by dating strata below and above it. For instance, at the Laetoli hominid site, there are several discrete horizons of laterally continuous and extensive volcanic ash distributed through the stratigraphy; [most of these volcanic event horizons were directly dated though weither U-Pb or K-Ar methods](_URL_2_). Detailled mapping allows to locate finds, such as stone tools or even the famous footprints, within this timescale and estimate their age. Addd to that an understanding of the sedimentation rates and you can refine the age estimate of pretty much anything found between two dated horizons to a pretty good degree.',\n",

You \"charge it up\" by holding it under visible light: this excites the atoms and locks them in the excited state.  When struck by infrared, the excited atoms return to their original state, releasing a photon.  The energy for their glow comes from the visible light they were charged with: the infrared is just a trigger.  Once the light is given off, that part of the card stops working until it\\'s recharged.\\n\\nThe other kind (the green card in the video) doesn\\'t need to be charged: these use the same rare-earth elements that the green lasers in the video use.

Like Brain_Doc 82, I\\'m definitely not an expert on the subject but for my my senior thesis I did a double blind study on binaural beats so maybe I have something to offer here.\\n\\n > Binaural beats are an auditory phenomenon created when the left ear and the right ear observe two discrete tones of similar frequency through headphones. The brain synthesizes the two tones creating a \\'beat\\' inside the brain. Maybe you can think of it like when you play two stings on a guitar that are slightly out of tune and you hear something like a waving (at least thats how it sounds to me) What makes binaural beats different from music is that the phenomenon is being produced as a result of the brain trying to synthesize two separate tones. kind of like when you view a 3d movie with with the blue and red glasses. the left eye and right eye are observing 2 separate images that the brain combines into one.\\n\\n > Depending on the size of the difference between the two tones you can produce alpha, beta, theta or delta wave frequencies. All of which coincide with different states of awareness.\\n\\n > Essentially the idea is that by playing binaural beats in say the delta range for example, after about 30 minutes or so you can trick the brain to begin operating on the delta frequency. This is why binaural beats may have a superficial relationship with music but should be regarding as two very different things. For example in one study I read, researchers were using delta waves (associated with sleep) on patients about to go under for surgery. They found that patients using binaural beats required less anesthetic and had faster recovery times than those using music or nothing at all.\\n\\n > hope this helps a little!',\n",

       "  'text': \"Debt increases whenever a new loan is originated. To simplify this from the global example, imagine two people in a closed economy who owe nothing to each other. There is zero debt in our hypothetical economy. If one of the two people wants to borrow money from the other, then she will owe the other one a debt until the amount is repaid. The lender loses cash now and the borrower gains the cash; the borrower also adds debt as a liability to her balance sheet. \\n\\nSo just like that, debt is created out of thin air whenever a new loan is made. Now, in terms of a global economy, loan providers mainly consist of central banks and private banks. Central banks can lend and borrow money by buying and selling bonds (depending on the country in question), which are just simple debt contracts. Private banks have more options to lend - car loans, home loans, student loans, etc. The money in this case basically originates from the country's printers at the end of the day. \\n\\nGlobal debt isn't good or bad in itself. The size of a debt can be an indicator of how much investment activity is occurring, for example. Some scenarios can cause debt to be a problem: massive deleveraging, for example, or an inability to repay. Greece has the latter case; the USA and all of Europe, a bit of the former. Inability to repay debts is caused by an excessively large amount compared to a nation's productivity and can cause the interest rate on their debt to spike. The nation faces two choices: inflate their currency to reduce the real size of the debt, or default on the debt and make their creditors angry. Greece is on the euro and can't inflate their way out of the problem. Massive system wide deleveraging, on the other hand, is caused when for some reason everyone wants to reduce their debts at once. In recent times this happened after a huge credit boom and subsequent bust in 2008. If everyone cuts back on their economic activity to try to pay down their debt, it can cause the actual value of that debt to increase even as it's being paid off because the nation may slip into deflation. \\n\\nNote that I'm talking about individual nations. We may at least partially be in a global deleveraging scenario now, although the research you linked suggests it's not a big one. But is the total amount of debt bad? Not really. It's just an accounting number. It's only bad when everyone agrees it's bad and you see interest rates spike across the world. Until such a thing happens, it's just a number.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'There are three main reasons:\\n\\n(1) The MORB mantle source was previously melt depleted. Modern MORB generation represents a second stage of melting, and therefore there are less LREEs available in this second stage.\\n\\n(2) The OIB source is generally enriched in LREEs by some mantle endmember (e.g. enriched contaminant). This may be a few percent of sediment, subducted crust, upper continental crust, or something else.\\n\\n(3) OIBs are generated more deeply than MORBs. OIB melting begins in the deep garnet peridotite facies, whereas MORB melting is within the shallower spinel peridotite facies. Because garnet sucks up HREEs (heavy REEs), all OIBs have higher LREEs than HREEs.\\n\\nSome quick things: OIBs are generated in the uppermost upper mantle not the lower mantle. The mantle source for OIBs may be sourced from the lower mantle, depending on the OIB locality in question.\\n\\nOIBs are not necessarily more differentiated than MORBs, but they are more enriched in incompatibles. This is related to the idea that the mantle sources of MORBs and OIBs are different.\\n\\nIn broad strokes:\\nMORB melt generation is shallow and there is no lithospheric mantle that separates the MORB melting region from the crust. Upwelling is slow and the melting region is cool. This leads to lower degree partial melts from previously depleted mantle. The result is basalts that are depleted in LREEs and have flat HREEs.\\n\\nOIB melt generation is deep and is separated from the crust (usually) by a layer of lithospheric mantle. This lithospheric mantle pushes the melting region into the garnet peridotite facies. The OIB melting source is usually hotter and more fertile. This typically results in incompatibly enriched basalts, but OIBs have a lot of variability and can erupt lavas with incredibly heterogeneous chemical compositions. Almost everything in the first three sentences of this paragraph varies from OIB locality to OIB locality.',\n",

(If it\\'s not, you\\'d be unlikely to get funding for it anyway) \\n\\nI don\\'t know the circumstances of why Strassman\\'s study was \"shut down\", but wouldn\\'t be simply because he was studying a controlled substance. Maybe he didn\\'t have a permit, maybe he was refused one because his research simply wasn\\'t deemed good enough. Or maybe he was refused funding for that or some other reason, and chose to self-servingly interpret it as a \"political\" move rather than accept that others might not have seen the same potential in his work that he did. \\n\\nThere\\'s any number of reasons that are a lot more plausible than DMT being a scheduled substance. Because that\\'s not really a problem. If you actually look, you\\'ll also find [lots of recent papers](_URL_1_) studying DMT in various ways.\\n\\nSo it\\'s being studied. The question is: What is it you think should be studied, how, and why? I\\'m pretty sure that despite what the article says, it hasn\\'t been \"proven in scientifically-documented, placebo controlled research studies to transport human beings out of their current physical and mental state into what can only be described as an alternate plain of existence\", unless you mean that yes, it\\'s a psychedelic drug. [Wikipedia tells me](_URL_0_) that Dr Strassman apparently has some wild conjectures on the substance and it\\'s role, ones that don\\'t have any supporting evidence or mainstream support. \\n\\nSo if you\\'re asking why the \"scientific community at large\" don\\'t study this thing more, then that\\'s your answer: Because there\\'s no evidence of these speculative theories, and because most of those who do study these things don\\'t believe it\\'s true. It\\'s good that you care about schizophrenia - I assure you the people studying it full-time do as well! But the fact that you apparently appreciate it as a recreational drug isn\\'t an argument for why these researchers should drop what they consider to be more fruitful avenues of research and focus on that. Having written a popular book on the topic isn\\'t either. People can write anything they want in a book, they can speculate freely, distort the facts, and present their wildest ideas free of criticism or dissent. So it should be taken with a large amount of salt. \\n\\nIt\\'s not at all difficult for an expert (in anything) to convince a layperson about almost anything in that area, since they simply lack the knowledge to dispute it. As long as it _sounds_ plausible, you\\'ll believe it. _Especially_ if the expert is telling you something you want to hear. You don\\'t even need to know what you\\'re talking about if you\\'re able to convince the person that you are: That\\'s how frauds, quacks, snake-oil salesmen and all kinds of pseudoscience stay in business.\\n\\nSo that\\'s why laypeople don\\'t get to decide what scientists do or who gets funding. By-and-large, the system works and things that (are generally believed to be) the most promising research ideas are the ones that get support and funding. It\\'s naturally not foolproof - we can\\'t predict the future, we can only act to the best of our current knowledge. Bad decisions certainly happen, but they\\'re seldom caused by petty things like \"Oh, that\\'s a recreational drug, and drugs are bad\". I don\\'t know any scientist who\\'d turn down a potentially big discovery, in particular not for that reason. Mostly, bad decisions are caused by, well, stuff like this: Because you have someone who\\'s much better at _selling_ his/her ideas than the ideas would merit, given a level-headed assessment. Because they have a theory that people would _like_ to believe is true. Because they over-exaggerate the importance of what they\\'re doing and it\\'s relevance, and get people caught up in flights-of-fancy. In short, because scientists are human beings too, and as such are susceptible to the same cognitive biases as everyone else. They\\'re just more aware of it, and therefore manage to avoid falling for it as often. A good scientist typically tries to be _more_ skeptical of something if they know they\\'d like it to be true, since our natural impulse is to do the opposite.\\n\\nOf course, as far as neurochemistry or what-have-you is concerned, I\\'m more or less a layperson as well. You shouldn\\'t trust _my_ opinion on whether or not DMT is worthy of more study. I don\\'t actually hold an opinion on that, though. What I _do_ have, is a _trust_ that the people who _are_ experts, who\\'ve spent years and years, full-time, studying this and related things, and who _are_ in a position to properly assess whatever potential you think DMT might have, are entirely capable of doing so, and aren\\'t being prejudiced by irrelevant things like the fact that its\\' a recreational drug. I suppose I have that trust because I\\'ve spent a similar amount of time acquiring as similar amount of expertise in my own field. So I know how little I actually once knew compared to what I know now, and it gives me an idea of how little I must know about _their_ stuff. \\n\\nNaturally, you\\'re free to study the subject, acquire the same level of expertise, and make your own assessment. But the odds are you\\'ll come to the same opinions on Dr Strassman\\'s ideas as the current majority does. Can\\'t the majority be wrong? Of course! But that doesn\\'t mean the opinion of a random layperson should be given equal weight. If you\\'re getting surgery, would you want the treatment most doctors recommend, or would you rather listen to the opinion of a guy on the street who was enticed by a flashy commercial?\\n\\nTL;DR: DMT _is_ studied.

Elements come from [a range of sources](_URL_2_) and nearby astrophysical events like a [neutron star merger](_URL_3_) or an exploding white dwarf have the potential to enrich the local interstellar medium in specific elements that are produced in that process.\",\n",

A higher demand for goods and services will end up causing demand inflation, which leads to higher prices for goods and services.\\nSince goods and servics have become more expensive, this negatively impacts consumers purchasing power.

This function is necessarily monotonically increasing (because the integrand defining it is strictly positive) and so it can, in principle, be inverted to give t = t(s). So time is a function of arc length. Then the curve itself can be written as x = x(s), y = y(s) on the interval 0 ≤ s ≤ L, where L is the total length of the curve.

Moving the [magnet in and out will make the bulb light up.](_URL_0_)\\n\\nWhy do we need a coil?   Why not just use a metal ring?   It\\'s because a magnet moved by hand will only produce a very very tiny voltage at the cut ends of the ring.  Humans can\\'t move the magnet fast enough.  One solution: use five hundred metal rings all connected in series.  That\\'s the coil.  With 500 turns of wire, it makes the voltage five hundred times larger; large enough to light up a one-volt bulb or a red LED.\\n\\nNote that these are all AC generators.  The moving magnet forces the wires\\' charges to move one way, then it makes them move back again.   If you want a DC generator, you\\'ll need to build a [rotating \"commutator\" switch](_URL_1_) which reverses the polarity of half of each AC wave.\\n\\nRule of thumb:  if you use a special light bulb that only needs 40 milliAmps at a couple of volts, then you can just barely light it using 250 turns of wire and some big ceramic magnets.    But if you use rare-earth neodymium magnets, then you only need about 50 turns of wire to light up the same bulb.   A red LED needs about twice the voltage of the most sensitive incandescent bulb.   So, 400 to 500 turns of wire for red LED with ceramic magnets, or 100 turns with the neo magnets.    Of course if you have a lot of patience, 1000 or 5000 turns of wire would be even better.  That way you won\\'t have to move the magnets so darned fast.',\n",

[This](_URL_0_) study shows is that ion channels are an important factor for the initiation of embryonic pacemaker cells; specifically Ca2+ through Ins-p3 dependent shuttle. They hypothesize that Ins-p3 releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) too a point of depletion. The depletion of Ca2+ from the ER results in oscillatory levels of intracellular Ca2+ (I couldn't find what pathway(s) intracellular Ca2+ then follows). But they find that inhibiting Ins-p3 did severely impact the beating of embryonic pacemaker cells as a result of reduced affinity for Ca2+ (I might have misread this part) as Ca2+ is an important molecule for all muscle contraction. In short, Ca2+ movement in and out of the cell is important for exciting embryonic cardiomyocytes and it might be a overstimulation of Ca2+ movement that may be the origin of the first beat.\\n\\nP.S. - I understand that the last part of this comment may be speculative, however, it was taken from the discussion section of the paper and I thought it provided an interesting idea that answers OP question.\\n\\nThere is a lot of molecular biology behind this phenomenon and tbh I got lost reading through the paper.

       "  'text': \"This might be more suited for /r/academia, but anyway:\\n\\nThe main thing to do to get a theory out there is to publish a paper in a scientific journal. There's a wide spectrum of journals and especially in broad fields. Journals range from very broad (Science, Nature) to extremely specific to a certain sub-field. Some journals are naturally more influential than others (this is measured with something called the 'impact factor'). Journals with a high impact factor are the best to publish in, but they are more restrictive due to the high number of submissions they receive and the quality requirements they have.\\n\\nAfter selecting a suitable journal and submitting the paper, the journals editor will briefly evaluate the paper to judge its relevance to the subject of the journal and the basic quality of the paper. The paper is then sent to a small number of reviewers (typically 2-3), who are scientists working in the field covered by the journal. The reviewers read the paper thoroughly and provide feedback. They can recommend the paper be rejected, accepted or anything in between (major revision followed by rereview needed or acceptance after minor revisions with no further review). The editor will decide based on the recommendations of the reviewers and pass the feedback on to the author(s).\\n\\nIf the paper has been successfully published the chances of it being read go up considerably. Especially if the paper references related work in the field, the authors of the referred papers will typically take a peek. The peer review process and the screening by the editor are both not perfect, but they do manage to filter out almost all papers that are flat out wrong or offer no value. Which is why most scientists will only read papers in established journals (and drafts only from colleagues that they know).\\n\\nWhile I can't judge the theory of the electrical engineer you mention, be warned that there are many, many instances of someone claiming to have the solution to a major problem in a field that they're not an expert in. The quantum physics of elementary particles and their interactions is vastly different from the physics you work with as an electrical engineer. The math may have internal consistence, but if some important aspect was overlooked, it may ultimately simply be wrong.\\n\\nFinally, there are people that will claim to have a revolutionary new idea but say they are unable to get the word out because they're being blocked by elitist scientists that don't want their views challenged. And while there certainly is some level of elitism in some fields, most scientists, especially younger ones, love nothing more than to be able to break the existing consensus in their field and work with revolutionary ideas. It's just that true revolutionary ideas come around far less often than some people would like.\",\n",

Light-years are an easier concept to grasp (i.e. the distance travelled by light in one year), but parsecs really are more convenient to do maths with.\\n\\nThe parsec comes directly from how distances to stars are measured. As the Earth goes around the Sun, we are constantly seeing stars from different angles. This causes stars to move in little ellipses in the sky. This is called \"parallax\". The size of this effect tells us how far away the star is. You can see a similar effect when driving in the country. The fenceposts by the road appear to be moving really fast while the distant mountains appear to the be totally stationary.\\n\\nA star is one parsec away if it moves in a little circle with a radius of one arc-second (1/60th of 1/60th of one degree) over a year. If its little circle is half an arc-second, it\\'s two parsecs away. If it\\'s 1/10th of an arc-second, it\\'s 10 parsecs away. So, given that astronomers like using arc-seconds to measure angles in the sky, using parsecs makes the mathematics really simple. It\\'s a geometric unit that we can measure directly. Light-years are less direct, because we can\\'t directly time how long it takes light to reach us from a distant star - we have to calculate it from the speed of light and the distance.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a convenient trick that 1 km/s is extremely close to 1 parsec per million years. Alpha Centauri is a bit over a parsec away. So if you know your speed in km/s, you can very easily calculate how many years it would take to reach Alpha Centauri or whatever.\\n\\nSo the real question is: if we actually use parsecs all the time, and they\\'re more convenient units, why do we teach kids about light-years? It\\'s probably because they\\'re just a little bit easier to teach, but that\\'s very much a social question rather than an astronomy one.',\n",

It is not a change in state, it is simply a change in properties of the current state of the matter (viscosity or thickness).

Coconut oil is a very complicated example as [it is made up of numerous different fatty acids](_URL_0_).

Production of biomass from trees or blooms in the surface ocean are short term processes and have relatively rapid turnover (10s to 1000s of years). Carbon burial is a long-term geological process that occurs over 1000s to 100,000s of years. (I CO2 is doubled it takes a long time to return to a pre-perturbation baseline).\\n\\nSo lets take the current anthropogenic CO2 scenario and play it out in a geologic context. We are adding carbon to the atmosphere. That carbon interacts with rocks on the surface of the earth and dissolves them ( < a href=_URL_0_ weathering < /a > ). When CO2 dissolves rocks that contain silicate materials (like granite) the CO2 is consumed and ultimately buried in the ocean as calcium carbonate. In this case it takes 2 CO2 molecules to dissolve one silicate. Ultimately one is buried because when calcium carbonate is precipitated in the ocean one CO2 is also released. (I can provide more on this if you want) \\n\\nWhen you add CO2 to the atmosphere, the temperature increases and that increases the rate of weathering. This is a result of temperature effects on the rate of the reactions as well as a result of an increase in the rate of hydrological cycling. Higher temperatures roughly equal more rain in the rainy parts of the world (not so simple as I am making it). There are additional constraints on the weathering of rocks, like the availability of weatherable material, but that is more detail than is needed here. \\n\\nNow there is a second piece to this that takes out more CO2. When you weather rocks you also release the phosphorus that is present in the rocks. Ultimately the P ends up in the ocean from rivers. Phosphorus is generally considered to be the primary limiting nutrient for marine productivity. The extra P enhances marine productivity and a very small fraction of that productivity is ultimately buried in sediments and taken out of the modern carbon cycle. Over time carbon is removed from the atmosphere.

When I pass my sample into the ICP-MS - all the thorium isotopes have the same ionization efficiency as each other. The data I get on the other side is \"counts per second\" of 229, 230, and 232 thorium. I know the ratio counts per second of 230/229 and 232/229, and I know exactly how much mass 229Th I added to the sample - so I can calculate the mass of 230Th and 232Th present in my sample. \\n\\nThe good thing about using ratios is that if something happens during processing - say, you spill a sample - it doesn\\'t matter.

You can overcome this by using two spikes the same isotope (Say, 228Th and 229Th). Since you know the ratio you added them in, you know what the count ratio should be. Deviations in the count ratio can then be attributed to mass bias effects in the ICP-MS, which you can then extrapolate to the other isotopes you measure like 232Th and 230Th (assuming a linear relationship between mass bias and mass offset). \\n\\nWe typically calculate mass bias by simply running a uranium standard with a known 238U/235U ratio, then assume the measured deviation in this ratio is due to mass bias effects.\\n\\nOr, as /u/Dr_Dickie suggests, you could just add another spike right before you run your sample on the ICP-MS to calculate what your yield was.',\n",

At the end you're left with a simple linear equation involving a number of unknown temperatures and some other numbers.\\n\\nIf the side is on a Neumann boundary, you already know the flux across that boundary: it's given by the Neumann BC.

Fields are things which can take different values at different points in space and time.\\n\\nSuppose we have a field theory with a charge that is conserved, but for which there is no force associated with that charge.

Throoughout the whole ball, the field has the same value at any time, but the particular value oscillates sinusoidally by going repeatedly around a circle of values.  It turns out that such a configuration has a non-zero charge, and, if the potential energy function (or, equivalently, the forces) in the theory has the right form, this configuration will have the lowest energy of any configuration of that charge.  This ball is called a *Q-ball*.\\n\\nNow enter quantum mechanics.  Quantum mechanics says these fields can also make particles.  The amazing thing that can happen is that when the Q-ball is stable classically, it is also the case that the particles have a higher amount of energy per unit charge than the Q-ball, so that even in the quantum version of the theory, Q-balls are still stable.

This can be due to drift (sampling variance) or draft (hitchhiking effects, e.g., clonal interference). If it is beneficial, it needs to rise to a frequency such that selection \"takes off\" and it starts to grow exponentially (at first). At this point, the allele is unlikely to be lost. This phenomenon, where an allele transitions from being governed by stochastic effects to being governed by deterministic selection, is what is meant by \"establishment\". The required number of individuals for establishment to occur scales as 1/*s*, with *s* the selective coefficient of the mutation.\\n\\n\\nYou can see, e.g., the first ten pages of [Desai and Fisher (2007)](_URL_0_) for a discussion of the dynamics of this in a haploid species. \\n\\n\\nNow, in a diploid species, there\\'s no particular *a priori* reason to expect beneficial alleles to be either dominant or recessive. (This is to be contrasted with deleterious alleles, which are usually recessive; as you probably know, this is because most deleterious alleles are loss-of-function mutations, and having one good copy of a gene is usually enough.) So, the question becomes: *given that you observe a beneficial trait in the population*, is it dominant or recessive?\\n\\nConsider that recessive mutations need to drift to a higher frequency before they establish. For example, assuming panmixis, a mutant lineage with a selection coefficient *s* = 0.1 would need to reach not 10, but perhaps 100 individuals (not sure about the scaling, but something like 1/*s*^2 seems intuitive). This will take longer and have a much lower probability of happening. On the other hand, a fully dominant mutation follows roughly the dynamics outlined in the haploid case, so it\\'s much more likely to establish than if it\\'s recessive. Thus, if you\\'re able to observe the mutation later, it\\'s likely that it was dominant.\\n\\nIn practice, beneficial mutations will probably be neither fully dominant nor fully recessive, but have penetrance somewhere between these two extremes.

       " {'question': 'How will it affect US economy if bill gates were to transfer all his money to some other country ?',\n",
       "  'text': 'The exact disposition of Bill Gates\\' personal wealth isn\\'t information we can get our hands on, since he\\'s a private citizen and it\\'s none of our business. So instead let\\'s make up a person with the same order of magnitude of wealth, imagine how he would store his wealth, and then answer the question based on that.\\n\\nSo here\\'s Mr. John Smith, with a net worth of $100 billion, making him very wealthy indeed. To keep things simple, let\\'s assume he carries *no debt at all* (which is implausible in the extreme), so his net worth comes from just the sum total of the value of all his assets.\\n\\nWhat exactly are those assets?\\n\\nWell, let\\'s say that a *very small fraction* of that wealth is in cash. Everybody needs to deal in cash transactions on a regular basis (paying for lunch, putting gas in the car and so on), so let\\'s say that Mr. Smith has cash holdings with a value of …\\xa0oh, let\\'s say $100,000. Just to pick a figure. That\\'s the account he spends his money out of, to pay the electricity bill and such like that.\\n\\nWhere exactly is that money? If we imagine that it\\'s sitting in *cash* —\\xa0literal currency, like bills and coins — in a vault somewhere, we\\'ll be quite wrong. Mr. Smith *could* store his cash assets that way, but he doesn\\'t, because that\\'s not a reasonable thing to do. Instead he keeps his cash holdings in a bank account. In that form, his cash wealth (which remember, has a value of $100,000) exists as a *liability* on the books of his bank. Basically, that means Mr. Smith goes to the First National Bank of Wherever and says \"I will give you $100,000 if you promise I can come ask for it back whenever I want.\" The bank says sure, and takes his money, and in return gives him their promise that he can withdraw it at any time. That makes the bank *liable* to Mr. Smith for that money.\\n\\nIf Mr. Smith wants to move that money overseas, it\\'s no problem at all. He simply goes to the bank and asks for whatever cash they\\'re liable to him for. The bank provides it in whatever form Mr. Smith prefers (currency, or more likely a bank check), and Mr. Smith goes about his merry way. The bank can do this because *banking regulations require* banks to be able to give their depositors the money they\\'re owed whenever they\\'re asked for it. So the bank will always be able to give Mr. Smith what he asks for. If the bank ever *can\\'t* give Mr. Smith what he asks for (as well as all their other depositors), the bank will be *insolvent,* and a regulatory organization called the FDIC will step in to conduct an orderly closure of the bank and transfer of its assets and liabilities to another institution.\\n\\nSo all that is a very long-winded way of saying that if Mr. Smith wants to withdraw his cash and put it in another bank overseas, he will have no problem doing so, and there will be no effect of his doing so, because banks are regulated to make sure that\\'s true.\\n\\nWhat about the rest of his assets? Well, Mr. Smith keeps them, as any reasonable person would, in a diversified collection of various things of value. We can broadly divide that collection into two categories: Things which are *easy* to sell, and things which are *hard* to sell. Things that are easy to sell include shares of mutual funds or stocks, for example. Those are things which a great many people want all the time, so if Mr. Smith decides to sell them, he\\'ll have no trouble at all finding a buyer.\\n\\nLet\\'s imagine Mr. Smith owns 10,000 shares of a particular mutual fund. If he wants to, he can sell those shares at whatever the current market price is, then take the cash and deposit it in his overseas bank account. This will be very easy for Mr. Smith to do; it\\'s just a phone call to his broker, who just has to put a sell order into his computer and then cut Mr. Smith a check for the profits. Mr. Smith then takes that money and sends it to his new overseas bank, where it gets credited to his account.\\n\\nThat\\'s generally true of all of Mr. Smith\\'s *liquid* assets — that is, assets which are very easily converted into cash. He can sell them quickly and easily for pretty much their nominal value, and then take the cash from those sales and do whatever he wants with it.\\n\\nSo now Mr. Smith has the $100,000 in cash he withdrew from a US bank and deposited into an overseas bank … and also some huge sum, in the billions of dollars, he had invested in securities which he liquidated and deposited in his overseas account.\\n\\nBut what about the rest of Mr. Smith\\'s assets? His home, his furniture, his car, all those things? These are called *illiquid assets*, which generally means they\\'re hard to sell. In order to sell his house, Mr. Smith needs to find somebody who wants to buy it. That\\'s not guaranteed to be an easy thing to do! In fact, Mr. Smith might be unable to find *any* buyer for his house without lowering his price to some small fraction of what his house is nominally worth. So either he can choose to sit on those illiquid assets until he finds a buyer for them, or he can sell them at a loss to get out quickly.\\n\\nSince the premise of the question is that Mr. Smith wants to \"transfer all his money to some other country,\" we\\'ll assume that he wants out even if it costs him money. So we\\'ll say he sells all his illiquid assets for pennies on the dollar. The result here is pretty obvious: Mr. Smith\\'s net worth goes down! He converted assets with a certain nominal value to cash of *less* value, so he\\'s worth less money in total. But the good news is now he has his cash, so he can send that to his new overseas bank as well and deposit it.\\n\\nNow Mr. Smith has successfully moved all his money to \"some other country.\" What\\'s the net result on the US economy? Essentially none. Mr. Smith\\'s cash holdings were very small, and the bank had no problem covering their liability to him, so that doesn\\'t have any effect. All his liquid assets — shares of stock, mutual funds, bonds and so on —\\xa0were easy to sell, so other buyers snatched them up at fair market value and no significant change in wealth occurred there; assets just changed ownership. Mr. Smith sold off his *illiquid* assets at a loss, so he took a hit, but other parties got a bargain, so the net result there is pretty much nil as well.\\n\\nBut of course, now Mr. Smith has a problem. See, all his money (less the losses he took from liquidating his holdings) is in *cash,* and that\\'s not good. Mr. Smith now has to turn around and use his cash to *buy more assets,* so his money can earn him an income. In so doing, he ends up investing his money *right back into the same companies he was holding before,* because they\\'re still the right choice for him. Along the way, Mr. Smith has to cover certain fees incurred by selling and buying securities, so he loses some money, but the total overall net result on the economy is … well, absolutely none, really. Assets changed hands, and a little wealth was created and a little wealth was destroyed, but no significant effects occurred … except for Mr. Smith having to do a heck of a lot of paperwork for no real reason.',\n",

       "  'text': 'First what is a urinary tract infection (UTI). A UTI is essentially just inflammation of the urinary lining in response to an infection. When detecting a UTI we generally are looking for two things: bacteriuria (the presence of bacteria in the urine which generally does not have detectable bacteria) and pyuria (signs of inflammation). Bacteriuria can be present without a UTI. This occurs in colonization (having bacteria on the bladder lining).  \\n\\nIt is hard to look at your question using recent data because, most often, people are treated when diagnosed. There have been some studies looking at bacteriuria in women and have shown that it will go away without treatment in 60% of women within a month. In one series of 45 women left untreated, all but 2 were able to clear their bacteria by six months.  Interestingly, this same study found that treating with antibiotics did little to prevent the recurrence of UTIs.  \\n\\nSo, why treat? One is to provide expeditious symptomatic recovery. Additionally, there are some bad outcomes that can result from a UTI. One is pyelonephritis (infection of the kidney). Generally, urine from the bladder does not go back to the kidney, so infection should not spread in most cases. A couple of conditions make it more likely to spread and as a result require more aggressive treatment. One is pregnancy, women with untreated bacteria in their urine have greatly increased rates of pyelonephritis. The other is vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR), a condition in some children which results in the passage of urine from the bladder up to the kidney. \\n\\nAnother concern is sepsis. Sepsis is an over-response to infection. Older patients are much more at risk of this and are also more at risk of having bacteria from a urinary tract infection pass into their blood (bacteremia). \\n\\nA final concern is that chronic urinary tract infection may be a potential risk factor for bladder cancer, though this link is not well established in the general case.',\n",

So the first thing you have to realize is that diving in a mafic flow would be more like diving into the floor of a sand pit than diving in water: you'd probably hit pretty hard, depending on the total height of your fall, and you wouldn't sink at all. You'd sort of just sizzle and smoke on top of the slowly deforming flow. \\n\\nNow the temperature; mafic flows are usually somewhere around 950° C or a bit higher. Such temperatures are incompatible with life, thermal shock would be instantaneous. For comparisons sake, the pyroclastic flows and ash at the Montagne Pelée eruption, which killed several thousand people, were around 200° C (see: [Baxter, P. J., Neri, A.,  &  Todesco, M. (1998).

       "  'text': 'Edit:  Sorry for the super long post, just wanted to be thorough in addressing that guy\\'s two claims, because both are wrong.  Feel free to see the TL;DR at the bottom.\\n\\nI recall that this question has been asked here before with a similar situation and some different claims.  The ultimate answer that was given was that plasma cosmology is, as you noted, a crank hypothesis that makes a lot of claims for which there is no observational evidence.  I tried searching both r/AskScience and r/ScienceFAQs but was unable to find the thread I remembered.\\n\\nAnyhow ... being unfamiliar with plasma cosmology I cannot attest to all of the claims that the theory makes.  However, I can address this part of your question:\\n\\n > That theory [expansion of space] is also totally stupid nonsense. Plasma Redshift explains Redshifting fine without any need for Expanding \\'Space\\' which is a completely non-tangible entity with no properties - space is not a thing.\\n\\nThe way space is modelled in physics (particularly, mathematical physics) does not make it a \"completely non-tangible entity with no properties.\"  It may not be tangible in the sense that you can reach out and touch it, but space most certainly does have properties, and you can mathematically construct different spaces with many different properties.\\n\\nMathematically speaking, a [space](_URL_9_) is \"a [set](_URL_3_) with some added structure.\"  A set is a collection of elements, and generally when talking about a space those elements are called \"points.\"  And generally the set is also an infinite set.\\n\\nThis alone does not allow you to define very much about a space, hence the need for \"additional structure.\"  For example, without additional structure you cannot define distances between points.\\n\\nTypically, spaces include a [metric](_URL_7_) -- also known as a \"distance function\" -- that takes two points as arguments and assigns a proper distance between those two points.  Spaces with metrics are called [metric spaces](_URL_7_).\\n\\nFor example, if we imagine a 1-dimensional space, where the points are the real numbers **R**, we might have a very, very simple metric that looks something like this:\\n\\n*d(A, B) = |B - A|*\\n\\nSo if we chose the points (5) and (7.3) and calculated the distance between them, we would get:\\n\\n*d(5, 7.3) = |7.3 - 5| = 2.3*  (arbitrary units)\\n\\nWe could of course also change the metric to add a scale factor, such as:\\n\\n*d(A, B) = 2.5 × |B - A|*\\n\\nAnd if we chose the same two points, (5) and (7.3), we would see that the distance is greater than with the non-scaled metric:\\n\\n*d(5, 7.3) = 2.5 × |7.3 - 5| = 5.75* (arbitrary units)\\n\\nThis is overly simple of course, an actual metric is much, much more complicated and doesn\\'t have a structure this simple, but this example captures the basic idea.\\n\\nThings tend to naturally get more complicated when you have more dimensions.  For example an equivalently simple metric for three dimensions might look something more like:\\n\\n*d(A, B) = | √( (B_x - A_x)^(2) + (B_y - A_y)^(2) + (B_z - A_z)^(2) )*\\n\\nAnd so on; these examples of course would only make sense for a Euclidean space, but there are many different types of spaces, including [Minkowski space](_URL_5_) which has a time dimension in addition to the three of space, and there are all kinds of insanely weird spaces like [Calabi-Yau spaces](_URL_4_) with folded-up dimensions and all of that jazz.\\n\\nAnd spaces can also have things such as topologies making them [topological spaces](_URL_2_), and topological spaces which locally resemble Euclidean spaces are called [manifolds](_URL_0_) and there are a whole bunch of them, and so on.  It gets very complex and since I don\\'t understand it all myself I\\'m going to stop here.  But my point is, in physics, \"space\" actually has many mathematical properties, it\\'s not just \"something that is nothing.\"  The structure of space provides a substrate on which matter and interactions between matter can be defined, and different types of spaces yield different results in that regard.\\n\\nNow, to bring it home ... with respect to the \"expansion of space\" being nonsense, it really isn\\'t.  The reason I explained about metrics above is so that I could easily point out that the expansion of space is actually a [metric expansion](_URL_1_) -- meaning that the metric is *time-dependent*.  There is a scale factor in the metric that changes depending on the temporal coordinate.\\n\\nThis means, if you took two points in space, *A* and *B*, at some time *t*, and found they had some distance *AB* between them, and then later you took the distance again at some time *t\\'*, the distance *AB\\'* would be greater than *AB*.  The space has \"expanded\" over time.  Any matter at these points would have gotten farther away from eachother without any local forces acting on that matter to push them away, because it is the distance itself that has increased.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that *no new points are being added* to the space, it\\'s just that the notion of distance is larger at later times, by definition.

That of course is for sound waves, but it also applies to electromagnetic waves, and in fact [Doppler radars](_URL_6_) can detect the speeds of distant objects by measuring its EM redshift.  I\\'m fairly certain Doppler radars didn\\'t just magically drop down out of the sky for us to use, they had to be developed in a laboratory.  So there is plenty of laboratory evidence for the Doppler effect.\\n\\n**TL;DR:  This guy is wrong, there is plenty of laboratory evidence for redshift due to the Doppler effect, and he\\'s dead wrong when he says space has no properties or structure.  Clearly he just doesn\\'t understand how space is modelled mathematically -- so what kind of confidence can you have that he even knows anything about how \"plasma cosmology\" models space?**',\n",

So, for example, sit in the same seat in the classroom where you normally sit on test day, and if possible, do some active studying in that room/seat.  The physical cues around you will help trigger your memory.  If test anxiety is a problem, you should take steps to reduce the level of anxiety that you would with any other anxiety.  That would be a) practicing mindfulness: being aware that an increased heartrate, sweating, stomachaches, and other physical symptoms of anxiety are attributable to nervousness about the test, and \"talking yourself down\" from it (e.g., \"okay, my palms are sweating like crazy, it is just because I am nervous about this test, but I know I have studied and prepared as best as I can, and so I will concentrate on what I can do and know in the moment\").  b) exposing yourself to test conditions as much as possible beforehand to habituate yourself to the cues that cause nervousness.

       "  'text': \"Your question probably stems from a common but incorrect explanation you have been given in the past.\\n\\nAs is well known, the area of a sphere grows as r^(2), where r is the radius.  This is a geometrical property of three-dimensional Euclidean space.  Consequently, if you have some conserved quantity spreading out over increasing radii, you will see it spread out over a surface area that grows as r^(2), and so its density will go as 1/r^(2).  Thus, for example, the intensity of the light from a point source that goes out equally in all directions will decrease as 1/r^(2).  (Intensity is proportional to the energy.)\\n\\nThe classical 1/r^(2) behavior of the Coulomb force law, however, does not arise from this geometrical fact.  It arises from the physical properties of the force carriers.  In particular, if the force carrier is massless, the corresponding classical fundamental force goes as 1/r^(2).   If you're familiar with Gauss's Law in electromagnetism, you can understand it as the statement that this physical scaling coincides with the geometrical scaling.  (Thus, the form of Newton's gravitational force law is an indication that the prospective graviton, if it exists, is massless.)\\n\\nBut this makes it clear that there are other ways a force can behave.  For example, if the force carrier is massive, the force will drop off exponentially.  The W and Z bosons are massive, and so the weak force drops off exponentially with distance.  \\n\\nEven if the force carrier is massless, quantum mechanics tells us that there are modifications to the 1/r^(2) form, and depending on the relative importance of quantum effects, these modifications can be quite dramatic; the strong force, for example, once the separation between particles gets to be about 10^(-15) meters, stays essentially constant as the separation increases further.\\n\\nAnd, of course, there are non-fundamental forces that arise from (potentially complicated) interactions of other objects -- the tension in ropes, friction between two surfaces, or, at a simpler level, the net electric force between objects that are not point charges.\",\n",

However, since LTE can support more users (much larger bandwidth allotment and far better spectrum utilization) more per dollar spent (thanks to licensing and tech improvements) I will predict that it will.  \\n\\nNow to get a little more technical, but i\\'ll try to keep it somewhat simple.  With the old technologies channels are split between data and voice.  While data networks are pretty good at filling the space between users, voice is not.  If a voice line isn\\'t being used, that bandwidth is lost and only one call per voice line can be made at one time (circuit-switched).  Note that early data services were also data switched, to be put simply as far as line utilization, they worked much like a pc modem.  Technologies (CDMA-2000[1xRTT,EV-DO], GPRS, EDGE) which popped up around 2000 which switched data to packet switched data.  Packet switched data sends a small chunk at a time effectively allowing the network to be shared more efficiently as network traffic tends to be \"bursty\".  The proposed future LTE networks will bring voice traffic into the packet switched world (at least from phone to the edge of the public telephone network).  Essentially, this will allow data traffic to utilize what was voice when voice calls aren\\'t being made.  Voice will still be provided with a higher priority so that low latency full duplex communication remains possible.  The voice on LTE protocol is known as VoLTE, I don\\'t have an estimate as to when that will roll out as that is up for debate from a technology and business standpoint.  The two main issues technologically with VoLTE is hand-offs between towers and quality of service (ensuring that voice packets will arrive on time).  Economically, a new voice network needs to be rolled out, so until then 2G/3G will still be around.\\n\\nAs another point, how do you define phased out?

Different instances of Phil start to shift their physiology, depending on where they are in the growing wad of bugs.

Or just something that coordinates the swimming of the released planktonic bacteria so that they wind up attaching close to each other, giving the new biofilm a head start in hitting that critical QS concentration.\\n\\nJust to be clear: this is a GROSS oversimplification.

So all alpha particles should go straight forward (some randomization obviously happens).\\n\\nIf some were bended this means that some particles on, for example\", right hand side were **nearer** then particles on left hand side. As force depends on distance, one of particles was impacting alpha more and changed its trajectory. \\n\\nForce depends on distance with square dependency, so very strong. So if we have centralization of charge, then alpha particles that have a \"luck\" of travelling close to center have trajectory bended strongly, one that travels in distance - almost none.\\n\\nIf we have \"soup\" that, because of some randomization of charges, almost each alpha particle would be affected, but in small quantity, because of right and left forces contradicting each other.\\n\\nSo amount of strongly curved trajectories to amount of almost straight passes allows us to make conclude on centralization of charge.

So let\\'s do both.\\n\\nThe first is sort of analogous to virtual particles in nuclear/high energy physics. They are just intermediate states in some time-dependent process. What is Raman scattering? It\\'s inelastic scatting of light off of matter. So some atom starts off in some initial state (say the ground state), you shoot some light at it, and it ends up in an excited state, and the light scatters away. How does the atom get from the ground state to the excited state? Does it go directly there, or does it go there in multiple steps, jumping between intermediate discrete energy levels? If the latter, those intermediate states could be called \"virtual\".\\n\\nThe other option is more complicated. If you have some quantum potential well like [this](_URL_0_), you\\'ve got the possibility of bound states with negative energies, and you\\'ve got scattering states with positive energy.\\n\\nBut there\\'s also an in-between case called [*resonances*](_URL_1_). These have positive energy, but they\\'re not quite scattering states. They have some probability to escape to infinity, but their wavefunctions are localized due to the presence of some kind of barrier. In order to escape, they have to tunnel out of the barrier.\\n\\nVirtual states are basically what happens to bound states in the case where there is no barrier, and you make the depth of the potential well very small. They are kind of like resonances in that they have wavefunctions localized near the well, but they are like scattering states in that they freely escape.\\n\\nExamples of virtual states would be some s-wave neutron orbitals in certain nuclei. Neutrons have no charge, so they have no Coulomb barrier to hold them inside the nucleus. If they also have no orbital angular momentum, there is no centrifugal barrier to hold them in either.\\n\\nIn the limit where the depth of the nuclear potential well goes to zero, the bound s-wave neutron orbitals will at some point become virtual states instead of bound states.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Firstly, I probably have about the same level of education in the eye as you (mostly high school, some undergrad) so take what I say with a grain of salt.\\n\\nI\\'m assuming your question is why the human retina is arranged so that the photoreceptors are at the very back with all the other cells/cell structures placed in front, essentially \"blocking\" light from getting to them- an arrangement some would characterize as being *inverted*. As it has been explained to me in the past, it has been *suggested* that if the arrangement of the retina were reversed, that light that got past the photoreceptors would be more likely to be scattered and reflected off the other layers back at the photoreceptors and (since photoreceptors are not unidirectional) thus degrade image quality by creating \\'false signals.\\' As it stands now, any light that gets past our photoreceptors will immediately hit the pigmented layer and be absorbed. Consequently blind spots exist because nerve cells need a pathway for their signals to somehow \\'exit\\' the eye and connect back to the central nervous system and brain. Presumably, achieving this through a blind spot rather than say, distributing the nerve connections evenly between all the photoreceptors was the \\'better\\' option.\\n\\n**Tangent alert:** But as you already understand, the result of this arrangement of the retina, there is a whole mess of cells getting in the way of our photoreceptors that should be creating a \"shadow\" over our retina that along with blocking our visions, we should be able to see. Evolution has compensated for this using a [twofold approach](_URL_0_): Neurologically, our eyes and brain have evolved in such a way that we are actually insensitive to still i.e. static images. Thus the static pattern of cells that overlay our retina is invisible to us as, relative to the retina, it is perfectly still and unmoving. Of course this also should imply that if we stare at a still image long enough it would eventually vanish from our sight as well. The reason this doesn\\'t happen is because of the second mechanism. Even when we are staring at a still image, our eyes are in fact still constantly moving around JUST enough to prevent the \"static image\" effect from taking hold and making us go blind. Thus, even though these micromovements are what allows us to stare at still images, they have no effect on the cells blocking our photoreceptors since they are moving along with the entire eye and are in effect static\\n\\nHOWEVER as to your question as to the evolutionary significance of this, that is a much more trickier issue. According to the [wiki article on the subject](_URL_1_) (noticeably lacking in citations so again, grain of salt), some invertebrates (notably squids) have retinas where the layers are reversed i.e. photoreceptors are on the \"top,\" which suggests that other selective pressures may be at work that do not exclusively favor the arrangement found in humans. This appears to be an issue still open to a lot of debate and I\\'m hoping a redditor who\\'s research lies in this area can shed some light on the matter (pun intended) that is a little more accessible than the PubMed search results.',\n",

       "  'text': \"> So first, organic molecules such as glucose enter the cell. They are chopped up by various enzymes into smaller organic molecules, some of which are useful, and some of which are waste that is exhaled (CO2).\\n\\nMore along the lines of Glucose undergoes a series of reactions called [Glycolysis](_URL_2_) that turns it into a differeny molecule that can go through a specially designed energy creating pathway, [The Krebs Cycle](_URL_1_).\\n\\nGlycolysis itself releases a little bit of energy as ATP, but not much.  It's what organisms that don't breathe oxygen use, because the Krebs Cycle requires oxygen to function.  The goal of glycolysis in humans is to turn glucose (6 carbons) into two molecules of pyruvate (3 carbons each, totaling 6).  Each of those pyruvate molecules can go through the Krebs Cycle.\\n\\n > At that point, various enzymes start oxidizing them, stealing Hydrogen atoms. These Hydrogen atoms are passed from enzyme to enzyme, eventually resulting in the proton being pushed out of the mitochondria, while the electron remains within the mitochondria (attached to some protein).\\n\\n > That electron is then used inside the mitochondria to turn O2 (which you breathed in) into water, with the addition of some H+ ions from within the mitochondria. The net effect of all of this, is that a bunch of H+ have been pumped outside the mitochondria, and some more H+ has been turned into water, within the mitochondria. Therefore there is an electric potential across the mitochondrial membrane.\\n\\nNot quite, but not too far off either, surprisingly close for the second part.  We'll go back to the Krebs Cycle real quick.  So, to start off, pyruvate kicks off a CO2, and it gets replaced with a CoA molecule, so you're left with a 2 carbon Acetyl-CoA molecule that enters into the Krebs Cycle by joining with a 4 carbon oxaloacetate molecule.  This gives a 6 carbon molecule that starts the Krebs Cycle.\\n\\nLong story short, it undergoes a bunch of reactions that change the conformation, release 2 more CO2 molecules, release a little bit more energy as ATP, and also drop off the CoA, leaving you with the oxaloacetate molecule we talked about before.  This oxaloacetate molecule is now free to join up with another Acetyl-CoA and the cycle can continue.\\n\\nAnother important (probably the most important) aspect of the Krebs Cycle is that it produces reduced molecules, like NADH and FADH2 by giving protons to NAD+ and FADH+.  These NADH/FADH2 molecules go to the [Electron Transport Chain](_URL_0_), where they can really release a lot of energy.\\n\\n\\n\\n > That electron is then used inside the mitochondria to turn O2 (which you breathed in) into water, with the addition of some H+ ions from within the mitochondria. The net effect of all of this, is that a bunch of H+ have been pumped outside the mitochondria, and some more H+ has been turned into water, within the mitochondria. Therefore there is an electric potential across the mitochondrial membrane.\\nThere is one more protein, which is actually attached to the membrane, but porous to H+ ions. The electric potential forces the H+ ions through this protein, which uses that motive energy to build ATP, which the cell then uses for all its energy needs.\\n\\nThe proteins of the electron transport chain work literally as a chain to transport electrons.  They take a hydrogen off the NADH/FADH2, use the electron for redox reactions, and the H+ goes into a big pool of H+'s on one side of a membrane (think of it like a holding room).  The electric potential isn't so much important as the concentration gradient. Also, all the proteins of the Electron Transport are attached to the membrane, that's how they can all pump H+ across it.\\n\\nStill with me?  OK, this is where the real energy comes from.  The Electron Transport Chain creates a concentration gradient of H+ on one side of a membrane, which it then uses to produce ATP.  Literally, think it of a bunch of people exiting a room one by one through a turnstile, and then using the spinning of the that turnstile as a generator.\\n\\nIt's a pretty interesting thing, [ATP Synthase](_URL_3_) is that turnstile protein, and it literally looks like a turnstile.  It's not completely understood how it works, but that passage of H+ through the protein literally turns the top part around in a circle as it passes through, generating energy. \\n\\nThe movement of H+ through this turnstile is what generates the energy for your body to turn ADP (2 phosphates) and P into ATP (3 phosphates).  The final phosphate bond is a high energy bond that can be broken and energy can be released from it.  ATP is like the energy currency of your body, and it's used in tons of reactions.\\n\\nYour body takes the H+ that moves through the turnstile, combines them with O2 (remember how I said the Krebs cycle requires O2?  This is the only reason why.  Electron Transport isn't technically the Krebs Cycle, but your body won't even start the Krebs Cycle unless it has O2 because it would be a waste to produce all those reduced molecules and have nothing do use them for).  This produces H2O.  The CO2s that got knocked off during the Krebs Cycle, along with the CO2 are breathed out, and the ATP molecules are used for energy.\\n\\n\\nSorry if this is confusing.

However I\\'ll take a gander... \\n\\n > At what point did the need for individual names arise\\n\\nFirst names couldn\\'t have come about before the development of language. The origins of language are highly debated but two basic ideas stand out:\\n\\n1. That language developed over time from pre-linguistic systems from our pre-human ancestors and gained complexity within modern homo sapiens species.\\n\\n2. That language is strictly a homo sapiens trait, which developed quickly at the onset of our speciation and is unique to us.  \\n\\nI am more in camp 1 given the information we have at hand about proto-languages (including the possible use of gestural language). In any case modern language arose a long time ago, in the early stages of our species history some 250,000 - 100,000 years ago.\\n\\nMoreover your question would raise a secondary question of how complex does language - or the communication of ideas - have to be to be in order to have names? We may also ask if their cultures necessitated names. Just because names are possible does not mean they are used, or need to be used.\\n\\nI guess my answer is I don\\'t have a clear answer to that question.\\n\\n > Many domesticated animals know their name when we call them, and they respond\\n\\nThis is more of a conditioning response, the animal (probably) does not \"know\" that is is named \"calvin\". Part of understanding the meaning of a name involves theory of mind which is knowing that you are a separate being from other beings with your own independent thoughts. I know my thoughts differ from yours, and I also know that you have thoughts of your own. Some animals have been observed to show theory of mind mainly - dolphins, apes, other primates, birds (crows, ravens, pigeons). But the depth and complexity of this knowing the self and others is unknown and debated. \\n\\nI am inclined to think that an animal responding to its name is more of a conditional response then an actually knowing of self. That being said...\\n\\n > Do we know if animals have proper names for each other in any way\\n\\nNo, we do not know if animals give proper names to each other because we do not speak the communication of animals. Communication is complex, and its not really solid yet whether animals actually link particular sounds up with particular meanings (semantics). So that Call A means \"hawk! duck down\" or if Call A just elicits the response to \"duck down\" without the animal thinking through a complex thought process - \"ok hawk above me, look quickly, then jump down into the canopy for cover\". Lots of debate, my personal opinion is that there is some semantical meaning to animal communication systems, however it is not as complex nor as adaptive as human language.\\n\\nThat being said animals can recognize individuals and remember individuals based on previous positive or negative acts directed towards them. Patterns in fur, stripes, size, pheromones... all are cues used by animals to recognize familiar and unfamiliar individuals of the same or different species.  Moreover groups of animals can recognize members of their own group or members of other groups based on calls. They have no need for a name - their physiological traits and calls are their \"name\".\\n\\nI hope this clarifies things a bit...',\n",

We\\'re stepping on a thin ice of conjecture pretty often during such conversations. We *assume* that black holes do such-and-such things, but in reality we\\'ve only observed a few of them, of cosmic sizes, and only while performing some pretty trivial actions, such as bending trajectories and capturing gas clouds.\\n\\nSecondly, it has been calculated that black holes lose energy via a mechanism called Hawking radiation. The smaller the black hole, the more powerful the radiation. Ergo, there has to be a minimal size for a black hole to be relatively stable and not disappear in an instant, in an explosion of Hawking radiation. Calculations indicate that any black hole heavy enough to remain stable a reasonable time is about as heavy as a hill or a mountain.\\n\\nAny black hole less heavy than that would lose energy ever more rapidly, eventually detonating like a very large nuclear bomb.\\n\\nIf black holes were really at the heart of the alleged ball lightning phenomena, obviously they should be stable. Therefore, they will be enormously heavy. And now you have to explain an additional difficulty - how does an object as heavy as a mountain fly through the air like a leaf blown in the wind? The black hole \"hypothesis\" doesn\\'t make explanation easier, it makes it more difficult.\\n\\nThis is not science, not yet. This is a long-standing topic of pseudo-science (ball lightning), seasoned with wild assumptions (black holes). Assuming the phenomenon is real, the first thing to do is wait for confirmations and additional independent research. If and when we learn more about the properties of these alleged objects, *only then* we can start hypothesizing about their nature.\\n\\nUntil then, \"explaining\" ball lightning by invoking black holes is a bit like explaining Santa Claus by invoking the Tooth Fairy.',\n",

Ditto with lice; *Isocyamus delphinii* has been found on orca, along with several other small toothed whales.\\n\\nSaying that, whale barnacles are much more common on the larger baleen whales, and rather scant, relatively speaking, on orca. Why? Very little is known about whale ectoparasites (I mean, if you have the time and means to get right up close and personal with a friggin' whales, why aren't you studying the actual whales?!), though there are a few hypotheses.\\n\\nOne idea is that barnacles preferentially settle on baleen whales as, both barnacle and whale being filter feeders, the whales carry the barnacles to the most productive feeding sites. Toothed whales hunting squid in the depths aren't necessarily gonna' be taking barnacles where they want to go. \\n\\nAdditionally, smaller toothed whales, such as orcas, more often inhabit coastal waters, where they're much better and more frequently able to engage in behaviours that help remove parasites - [scrubbing themselves against gravel banks](_URL_3_), for example. \\n\\nFinally, it might also be down to temperature. One study on parasitism in orca populations off the coast of South Africa noted that while one group of orcas in relatively warm waters hosted colonies of *Xenobalanus* barnacles, another group further South in much cooler waters didn't. Now, *Xenobalanus* can be found on whales in pretty much all waters across the world - including Arctic and Antarctic waters. Curiously however, it's only the larger baleen whales that host them in colder waters - the same whales that migrate to the tropics to breed. So while adult *Xenobalanus* may happily tag along on a cruise to the Antarctic, perhaps the barnacle larvae can't tolerate the chilly latitudes at all - explaining why it's only whales that live at, or at least visit, warmer waters that are encrusted. Orca pods don't typically stray anywhere near as much as, say, their humpback cousins; so perhaps if you and your buddies are hanging around the pole all year 'round, there's little chance a sun-lovin' barnacle baby will latch on to you and grow.\\n\\nGiven how little we know about whale barnacle lifestyles however, the above is mostly conjecture.\\n\\nWhat's more, in addition to the above, another answer arises by twisting the question to '*why do baleen whales get loads of massive parasites*'? Turns out, it's thought that some species, such as humpback and gray whales, actually encourage barnacles to grow on them for defence. Idea is a thick layer of barnacles can act as a deterrent against would-be-predators such as, well, orcas; preventing 'em from getting a good bite in. \\n\\n**TL;DR:** Orcas *do* get lice, barnacles and other nasties. They do however seem to host relatively fewer than their larger krill-nomming contemporaries. Might be because killer whales don't enjoy barnacle food, but do like a cheeky rub and cool waters. Might also be to do with how some baleen whales take a hit to their hydrodynamics for a defence bonus, versus predatory whales wishing to max out in the hydrodynamic skill tree.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n**^References:**\\n\\n[^(Ford, J.K.B.  &  Reeves, R.R.

       "  'text': 'Big question my friend.\\n\\nCovalent Bonds: Atoms form together to form molecules. I am not a quantum physicist, so I can not explain this process perfectly, but simply put, atoms join together because that is what they do. That is the nature of out universe. By sharing electrons, they form a lower energy state, and they like to have low energy. This is a very strong bond. Thus, water, tends to stay as water, rather than breaking down into hydrogen and oxygen. So, first we need to think of the various types of big molecules that make up your body. Remembering, that generally speaking, molecules are stable, and wont break down unless acted on. And they are stable because of covalent bonds, the sharing of electrons that atoms like to do.\\n\\nFats: Fats... you know what they are. But on a molecular level, they are long changes of carbon atoms hung together, with some hydrogen atoms. Different fats have different lengths of carbon, hung together in slightly different ways. This is what makes some fats liquid at room temperature, and some solid.\\n\\nProteins: Proteins are where you body gets exciting. These are made from little molecular building blocks called \"amino acids\" There are 21 different amino acids that your body uses. And each one is a group of 10-40 atoms joined together via those covalent bonds. The body knows what to do with these amino acids through various complex systems. Think of them like lego blocks. They all have slightly different shapes and properties, but they all join together, \\n\\nDNA: DNA (and other nucleic acid) is also made building blocks, 4 or 5 different types. This is (generally) the information store for your cells. Think of it like a book, but instead of having hundreds of thousands of different words, DNA has 4. The order of those words tell the story. In this case, DNA tells the body how to make protein. \\n\\nCarbohydrates. Sugars, starches. Again, we have building blocks. You may have heard of glucose? Well that is your sugar buidling block. This can get joined with other similar things, to make long chain sugars, that your body stores for energy (along with fats, which are also energy stores).\\n\\nNow you know what makes up a cell, lets build one. Your body is made up of millions of cells. About a 10th the width of a human hair. They are little bags, The wall of the bag is made up of those fats we talked about. Slightly modified, so that they like to disolve in water at one end, and hide from water in the other. If you get enough of these fats together, the spontaneously form into little bags, much like how soapy water will spontaneously form bubbles. Inside the bag, i.e. the cell, smaller little bags of fats are made, where different reactions happen. What kind of reactions? Well this is where protein comes in.\\n\\nProteins can be made to do huge amounts of amazing things, just like lego. With a few buidling blocks, you can make almost anything.\\n\\nLook at this video\\n\\n_URL_0_\\n\\nThis is a protein in action. They have many truly amazing actions. Muscle contration is because of long fibres of proteins in your muscles pulling on each other. You see because of light sensitive proteins in your retina. You name it, proteins are doing it. The other amazing thing they can do, is force chemical reactions. Here they are called \"enzymes\". They can act in various ways, but just think about it like the protein grabbing one molecule, and another, and then forcing them together. They force them together in such a perfect way, that the form new covalent bonds. Your enzymes produce a lot of the raw material for your body by forcing molecules together, or breaking them apart (there are a few things we can\\'t make, and hence we need to eat them, like vitamins).\\n\\nSo, now we have cells, bags of fat, with proteins working inside.\\n\\nFinally, on those cells, other proteins can sit; trapped in the fats. These proteins can be used to make your cells rigid (otherwise they would just be floppy bags). And they can also join together with the proteins on other cells. Linking all the cells together to form organs.\\n\\nSO there you go\\n\\nAtoms go with other atoms via covalent bonds, which are very strong, to form molecules. Molecules get joined up (also via covalent bonds) to make fats, DNA, protein and carbohydrates.\\n\\nModified fats make the cell wall, and proteins inside the bags do the molecular work, including making new things, and fixing old things. Proteins of the surfaces of the cells, make the cells rigid, and join cells together to make tissues.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Part of the problem is that the logarithm for a negative base doesn't really give what you expect. Consider how we would calculate log*_(-2)_*(4). Since (-2)^(2) = 4, we would probably want this answer to be 2, to be consistent with Log, as defined on positive real numbers. Well... let's see what happens. Use the change of base formula to write\\n\\n >  log*_(-2)_*(4) = log(4)/log(-2)\\n\\nNow we have to choose a branch of the logarithm. The reason is that w = log(z) is supposed to be a number such that e^(w) = z. If z is non-zero, then there are infinitely many such w, because the exponential is periodic. All such such solutions differ by an integer multiple of 2πi. To choose the branch cut, we first have to write a complex number z in polar form:\\n\\n >  z = |z|e^(iθ)\\n\\nwhere θ has some restricted range to get a good definition of the logarithm. In particular, we must restrict θ to some half-open interval of length 2π. So then the logarithm is given by\\n\\n >  log(z) = Log(|z|) + iθ\\n\\nwhere Log means the usual logarithm on positive real numbers. (The standard primary branch restricts θ to (-π,π].) Let's go back to logarithm with a negative base. We have the following:\\n\\n >  log*_(-2)_*(4) = log(4)/log(-2) = [ Log(4) + iθ(4) ] / [ Log(2) + iθ(-2) ]\\n\\nThe standard branch has θ(4) = 0 and θ(-2) = π. So the number above is certainly not the expected value of 2. So how could we get a value of 2? Well, you can show that we would need to choose a branch cut such that\\n\\n >  θ(4) = 2θ(-2)\\n\\nBut since |θ(4)-θ(-2)| = π (the angular difference between positive and negative real axis), we would have to take a branch such that θ(4) = -2π and θ(-2) = -π. (Or a branch such that θ(4) = 2π and θ(-2) = π.) In other words, θ is restricted to the interval [-2π,0) (or the interval (0,2π]). Among other things, this implies that\\n\\n >  log(4) = Log(4) - 2πi  (or  Log(4) + 2πi)\\n\\nwhich is not simply Log(4). So if we want our negative base logarithm to give what we expect, then the normal logarithm on positive real numbers has a nonzero imaginary part. So... not what we want. \\n\\nIf you carry out the argument further, you will run into problems with other pairs of base and exponents. For instance, you will find that both the real and imaginary parts of Log*_(-2)_*(z) are not continuous. *A fortiori*, they are not differentiable, and so the entire function cannot be analytic. This is very bad since you really can't do any type of analysis with such a logarithm.\\n\\n**Summary:** So the moral here is that it's possible to define a logarithm for any base z with z ≠ 0 and |z| ≠ 1. (The latter requirement is not absolute, but there are plenty more problems if you try to define a logarithm with a base such that |z| = 1.) But that definition is not going to be consistent with usual logarithm defined on positive real numbers.\",\n",

It's relatively experimental so I'll provide some educated speculation. \\n\\n* Firstly, the predominant cause for age and use-related joint pain is osteoarthritis.This is due to wear and damage to the cartilage on the bone ends and in severe cases there is bone rubbing on bone ([diagram of joint](_URL_0_)). Definitive treatment is joint replacement where the ends of the bone and the cartilage is replaced by a metal or ceramic prosthesis. This is a simple explanation. The fact that symptoms (pain) does not always correlate with the severity of joint damage as shown by radiology suggests that there is more to the disease than just cartilage wear.\\n\\n* In contrast the meniscus is a fibrous cartilagenous crescent shaped pads that partly divide the joint cavity are only present in some joints in humans. Similar to the cartilage they are involved in joint movement (reduction of friction). They can be injured acutely (a traumatic tear) or they can cause chronic joint pain (degenerative disease or chronic tears). The acute injuries can be treated conservatively or by surgical repair or tear or partial removal of the meniscus. However with chronic and/or degenerative damage it appears that surgical procedures are of no benefit (when looking at the population as a whole).\\n\\n* So there isn't really a good reason to replace a meniscus. Most joint pain is chronic degenerative pain where the meniscus either isn't involved and/or the meniscus pathology has little correlation with symptoms. Acute injuries of the meniscus where there is a a definitive injury to the meniscus that correlates with symptoms is a minority of cases of joint pain. Similarly meniscal injuries where an intervention to repair the meniscal injury leads to improvement is a minority of cases.\\n\\n* There is some controversy in this area so I'm sure that someone else will provide another opinion. There is artificial material available for artificial meniscus replacement and there is also cadaver material available for transplant. There was a review on the topic in ***Clinics Sports Medicine 2009 43(1), 143-156***. It appears that although there are some materials available for partial and complete meniscus replacement the procedure is limited by a lack of technical ability and also a lack of evidence for long term benefit.\",\n",

So it seems unlikely that we would ever detect individual gravitons.\\n\\nNow, this effective QFT seems to be pretty much the unique description of low-energy gravity, so if anything, it would be extremely surprising if gravitons did **not** exist. It would mean that quantum gravity is already not understood at low energies, and we would need to throw out a lot of our understanding.

Vagal stimulation acts as a 'brake' on heart rate, while adrenergic stimulation via epinephrine increases both the heart rate as well as how 'hard' the heart squeezes down to pump the blood.\\n\\nI said above that this rate is dependent on the blood pressure, which is itself dependent on the cardiac output and the vascular resistance.  The former is just a measure of how much blood volume the heart can pump per unit time, while the latter is a measure of how hard it is to pump that blood.  Cardiac output can be further broken down into stroke volume (how much blood each pump of the heart ejects) and heart rate.  So to put it together, pressure = stroke volume * heart rate * resistance (this is a variant of [Ohm's law](_URL_4_).

Classical uncertainty is the kind we\\'re used to from everyday life, nothing up my quantum sleeves. If I tell you I have a quarter in one of my hands, guess which?, then your subjective state of knowledge is a mixed state of \"it\\'s in the left hand\" and \"it\\'s in the right hand.\"\\n\\nWhat makes quantum mixed states interesting is the contrast with a coherent superposition, e.g. \"left *plus* right.\" At the macro level of quarters in hands, this leads to all sorts of weird Schrodinger\\'s cat type paradoxes, so it\\'s easier to think about a single two-level system, like a spin.\\n\\nIn some basis (call it z), a spin can be |up > ; it can be |down > ; it can be any superposition of a|up >  + b|down > . Any (complex) numbers you put in for a and b, this will still represent a pure state (normalize it if you insist). What makes it pure is this: **there is *some* axis you could measure it along, where you would be *certain* to get the up result; and the opposite axis, along which you\\'d be *certain* to get down.** This isn\\'t obvious if you\\'re not used to quantum mechanics, but an example will help:\\n\\nLet\\'s say you have the state |up >  + |down >  (I don\\'t normalize). If you measure along the z-axis, you are equally likely to get up as down (this is what you\\'d call \"quantum indeterminacy\"). But if you measure along the x-axis, you will get right always and left never!\\n\\nSimilarly if you have |up >  - |down > , along the x-axis you will get left always and right never.\\n\\nOn the other hand, let\\'s say you prepare *either* |up >  *or* |down >  with 50% probability. This is NOT the same as the coherent state |up >  + |down > . We have to write this as what\\'s called a **density matrix**, which is a different formalism (can explain more technically if anyone\\'s interested.) The upshot is that no matter *what* axis you measure along, you\\'ll get up/down (along that axis) with 50% probability; there\\'s no axis of certainty.\\n\\nAnother way in which mixed states arise is through considering only half of an entangled pair. There\\'s definite information in the correlations between the two particles, but with access to only one of them, it behaves in the unpredictable way described above.\\n\\nWhat makes mixed states weird in QM is (among other things) that there\\'s no unique decomposition (think reverse engineering) into pure states.

       "  'text': 'Let\\'s get some more concrete definitions in here:\\n\\nA **structure** of N lego bricks is defined to be N lego bricks in any combination, connected or not, touching or not.  However, the bricks are all oriented flat, and at right angles to the plane. The connector holes are always on the top and bottom as expected, and the bricks are rotated at any angle.  Hence there is only 1 way to place the 2x2 brick and 2 ways to place the 2x4 brick, when not accounting for rotation (we are not, here).\\n\\nTwo lego bricks are said to be **connected** if either of the following hold:\\n1. They are directly above/below the other with at least 1 connector hole overlapping, or\\n2. There is a chain of blocks connected as described in (1) which go between the selected lego bricks.\\n\\nA **building combination** of N bricks is defined to be a **structure** of N lego bricks where all N lego bricks are connected.\\n\\nTwo **building combinations** are said to be equivalent if they contain the same number of bricks and if the entire structure of one can be rotated so that the two structures could overlap perfectly - the same size bricks in the same exact places.\\n\\n-----------------\\n\\nSo, the question has become, are there more distinct building combinations of 50 2x4 legos or of 100 2x2 legos.\\n\\nAnd I say we can ignore the \"distinct\" restriction right off the bat.  Why?  It is only going to affect the result by at most a factor of 4, since there are 4 rotations, and worst case every determined structure when we count can be rotated into another.  But with numbers as big as they are, a factor of 4 is likely not to make a difference.  We can account for it at the end just to be sure though.\\n\\nNext... it is actually very very hard to try counting and not count the same thing twice, or to not miscount by counting impossible structures where bricks overlap.  To the point of, I\\'m not certain you\\'ll be able to get an exact answer here.  Or even a reasonably close answer.\\n\\nFor instance, let\\'s suppose we restrict the problem even further, and are okay with only adding legos on top of the last lego you added - we\\'ll make a wobbly tower.  With 2x2 legos, there are 9 ways you can add a new one on top.  And with 2x4 legos, there are (5 x 5) + (3 x 7) = 46 ways you can add a new one on top.  With that, we can get a pretty solid estimate of 46^50 versus 9^100.  But these are pretty close - only different by a factor of 10^12.  With this particular restriction, it is clear that there are more for 2x2, but we can\\'t just extrapolate and say it is clear without the restriction.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is to try comparing how many ways with one 2x4 versus two 2x2s, two 2x4 versus four 2x2s, etc.  But even that is very difficult to count without creating a computer program.\\n\\nMy last heuristic is to compare how you can add a 2x4 to another 2x4, and see if you can mimic that with 2x2s.  If you can mimic the connection, that it means we can construct a connected 2x2 structure that looks exactly the same as a 2x4 structure, just with 2x2s instead.  And this heuristic is what makes me think that there are far far more 2x2 building combinations than 2x4 building combinations.  If you iterate over the different ways of connecting a 2x4 brick with another 2x4 brick, you can either perfectly mimic it with 2x2 pieces instead, or else, you\\'re left with disconnected 2x2 bricks - which mean that they can be \"freely applied anywhere\".  Those disconnected bricks are a multiplier, giving rise to a lot more combinations than would otherwise be possible when restricted to the form of a 2x4 brick.\\n\\nSorry I can\\'t give a better answer - but this problem really has the feel of a problem from a computational algorithm contest, so if you really want a solid answer, try getting one of the experts there to work on it.',\n",

       "  'text': 'There are objects in math that pop up a lot, and we like to classify them. One such object is that of a Lie Group, which is something that can help find symmetries of objects. Particularly, Lie Groups are necessarily \"smooth\" objects and so they are great tools that can be used in differentiable systems, like PDEs or Lagrangian Mechanics or something. If you have a 2-variable PDE that you find is invariant under rotations (a smooth symmetry of the system), then you can reduce it to a 1-variable ODE, which are easier to solve. In physics, the symmetries of a system can help you find invariants of it, like energy, momentum, angular momentum. In fact, the Standard Model of Particle Physics is basically determined by the \"Lie Group of Fundamental Symmetries of the Universe\", which is SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1).\\n\\nSo Lie Groups are really important so we want to know/classify them, so that when we encounter a new one we\\'ll instantly know a lot about it based on its classification.\\n\\nMost of the fundamental Lie Groups (the building-block Lie Groups) fall into one of four categories: A*_n_*, B*_n_*, C*_n_*, D*_n_*. Each of these corresponds to a specific way that a Lie Group can be the symmetries of something and n is the \"Rank\" of the Lie Group, which is kinda a measure of the size of the Lie Group. These are categories that were created by some very clever mathematicians who wanted to classify Lie Groups and studied how they acted and picked out these kinds of actions and wanted to prove that all Lie Groups followed this pattern they created.\\n\\nBut this classification is not perfect. While most Lie Groups fall into these categories, not all of them do. In fact, there are exactly 5 (\"fundamental\") Lie Groups that do not. These each have a new classification invented to hold just them: G*_2_*, F*_4_*, E*_6_*, E*_7_*, E*_8_*. The only thing special about these five groups is that they don\\'t fit into the classification scheme that we came up with to classify Lie Groups. It\\'s entirely possible that we could come up with a totally different classification scheme for Lie Groups that does not have exceptions like this, or has different exceptions. \\n\\nE*_8_* is the largest of these exceptions to out classification scheme. Any Lie Group that is larger than E*_8_* nicely fits into the scheme. So we discovered it as an exception to our classification scheme. What it actually *is* would require more than an /r/askscience post.\\n\\nSomething analogous would be a classification of prime numbers: All prime numbers have last digit 1,3,7,9. This classification is incomplete and we have the exceptional cases of 2 and 5 that do not fit into this classification scheme, where 5 is the largest one. So 5 is to the final-digit classification of prime numbers as E*_8_* is to the A*_n_*, B*_n_*, C*_n_*, D*_n_* classification of Lie Groups. E*_8_* is an interesting Lie Group with interesting properties, but any mysticism around it is likely misguided (*cough* [Lisi](_URL_4_) *cough*).\\n\\n**TL;DR/ELI5:** We tried to classify some complicated objects used frequently in math, but our classification was not perfect and there were 5 exceptions to it. E*_8_* is the largest exception to our classification.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nAnalogously, one of the triumphs of modern math is a complete [Classification of Finite Simple Groups](_URL_2_), which does the same thing but instead of working with Lie Groups, which are continuous and differentiable, it does it for Finite Groups which are discrete and classify finite symmetries. This problem was much harder, and borrows ideas from Lie Groups. We finally proved that almost all finite simple groups fit into one of 18 specific infinite families of classifications, but there are a few exceptions. 26 exceptions, and these are called the [Sporatic Groups](_URL_5_). Just as above, these are just groups that don\\'t fit into the nice families that we found for finite groups.\\n\\nHowever, there may be something fundamental obstructing some of these groups from being nicely classified. A fairly magical connection between the largest sporatic group, the [Monster Group](_URL_6_), and something called the [j-Invariant](_URL_1_) which is from something pretty unrelated to finite simple groups, was identified by mathematician [John Conway](_URL_3_). They named the resulting theory [Monstrous Moonshine](_URL_0_) because you must be on moonshine to think that something like it is real. It has been  generalized to include some of the other sporatic groups, so perhaps this Moonshine plays a role in classifying finite simple groups into our nice categories that we missed before? I really don\\'t know because Monstrous Moonshine is complicated as fuck and it\\'s not my field.',\n",

In order to lose or gain thermal energy, that can happen a few ways: it can be transformed and lost  as long-wave radiation (eg, infrared), or if things get really hot, black-body radiation, or it can be gained by absorbing this radiation, or it can be mechanically transferred between molecules that come into \"contact\" with each other.\\n\\nYou can prevent the direct transfer of thermal energy by making sure that whatever you want to keep hot or cold is kept in a vacuum, so that there is very little other matter for it to exchange thermal energy with. And you can reflect long-wave radiation away from an object, or back onto an object, in order to keep it cool or hot, respectively.\\n\\nSo if you could make a container out of a material that is highly reflective to far IR radiation, and then put a near-perfect vacuum in it, with your food floating around in the middle, I\\'m guessing you could keep that food cold for quite a long time.

These signals tell your brain that you spinning, spin too much and these signals get stronger and trigger a nausea reflex, ***barf***.

So we suppose that very early in the universe, it grew at an extremely rapid pace, \"freezing\" temperatures into place across wide swaths of space.\\n\\nIf inflation happened, then early gravitational waves in the universe would be frozen in place and amplified during the inflation.

The important details about this structure is that you have a periodic ordering with a feature size on the order of a few hundred nanometers. This length scale is about the same as that of visible light, which is why such materials are called  [photonic crystals](_URL_4_) (or light crystals). \\n\\nA direct result of this periodicity is that these crystals will cause visible light to interfere with itself as it passes through the crystal. As a result, certain sharp bands will be reflected (where you get constructive interference) while much of the rest of the visible spectrum will simply be transmitted. In other words, photonic crystals rely on the same kind of interference that give oil slicks [their vivid color](_URL_0_), just with more control and definition. Moreover, just as in the case of the oil slick, the color of the light reflected from a photonic crystal will depend on the angle between the light, the crystal, and your eyes, [as you can see here](_URL_1_).\\n\\nNow of course naturally occurring opals are not perfect crystals. Instead, you will find a messier patchwork of irregular crystalline domains. As a result, they will shimmer in different colors in a complicated way as you move them around, [as shown in your gif](_URL_2_). Nevertheless, the basic physics of what you see is the same as what I describe above.',\n",

It contains part of the infamous E = mc^2 equation. If I flip it around, then I have m = E/c^2, so you might be able to see where this notation comes into play. In this equation, you can see that for a particle with mass in eV/c^2 (often closer to MeV/c^2), the energy is just in eV. So an electron at rest has a mass of 0.511 MeV/c^2 and a total energy of 0.511 MeV. It's more convenient, for example, in the full equation, because then you have (0.511 MeV/c^2 x c^2)^2 for the rightmost term, which is then just (0.511 MeV)^2. Makes everyone's lives a lot easier. Therefore, sometimes you will also see momentum in units of eV/c or MeV/c.\\n\\nSo, you can figure out the mass a bunch of different ways. I think what people do in practice is that they know both the energy and the velocity of the particles, which are two quantities you often hear about at particle accelerators.

Vaccines, for instance, are sometimes made from bits of the proteins in a particular microorganism that induce an immune response in people. Most medicines in use today, however, are what we call *small molecule* drugs. These drugs are relatively small organic compounds (carbon backbones, with oxygens and nitrogens here and there.) Humans have made lots of medicines from these drugs in part because we have advanced knowledge of making them to begin with--we have a lot of chemical skills for making them. Creating proteins to do what we want is an area that biochemists are just entering.\\n\\n- The mechanisms of all of these drugs vary enormously; typically, they interact with either your cells, or interact with other microorganisms in your body, and change how they function.

During this phase, blood flows into the atria as the pressure in the atria is lower than that in the veins (the whole cycle is about pressure). The pressure is also greater in the atria than the ventricles, as the ventricles are relaxed and empty. This means that the mitral and tricuspid valves are open, as they do not resist flow in that direction (due to lack of papillary muscles and chordae tendinae on the atrial side of these valves).\\n\\nAt the end of diastole, the atria contract, forcing most of the blood there into the ventricles (still at low pressure due to being comparatively large and empty). Very shortly after, the ventricles contract, raising the pressure above that in both the arteries and the atria. The raised pressure in the ventricles force the (mitral and tricuspid) valves closed, and they do not invert due to being anchored by the chordae tendinae in the ventricle, and thus prevent backflow.\\n\\nThe increased pressure in the ventricles rises above that in the aorta and pulmonary artery in the left and right respectively.

       "  'text': 'Hastatic order is the term that the authors coined to describe a break of double T-symmetry. T-symmetry is the idea that physics is the same whether time goes forwards or backwards. If we\\'re describing an object\\'s motion as time progresses, we can \"rewind\" by making the time parameter progress in the other direction. The object will just \"rewind,\" it\\'ll follow the same path just in the opposite direction. The equations of its kinematics do not particularly care which direction time is going.\\n\\nDouble T-symmetry is the idea that if you reverse time and then reverse it again, everything should be the same. That seems like a trivial statement (reversing twice just ends up with time going forwards), but it will become important soon.\\n\\nMagnetic fields do not obey T-symmetry (note for the scientists here that I\\'m using a loose definition of \"T-symmetry\" which is distinct from the one used in QFT). If you reverse the direction of time, magnetic fields flip over. This can be explained by the fact that magnetic fields are pseudovectors, ie they arise from a cross product.\\n\\nPseudovectors are distinct from regular vectors in the way that they change under symmetry operations. Consider two vectors, a and b, in Cartesian 3-space. I\\'ll then define a third vector, c, such that c = a x b. I then mirror a and b across some plane, for example zy. Only the x components of a and b are changed (they\\'re multiplied by -1), but all of the components of c change by a factor of -1. c is a *pseudovector* and transforms differently under symmetry operations than regular vectors.\\n\\nIf I perform my symmetry operation again, c\\'s original state is restored (as, of course, are a and b). So, the psuedovector transforms like everything else under a *double* symmetry operation, but not a single symmetry operation.\\n\\nLikewise, typical magnetic fields are understood to break T-symmetry, but not double-T symmetry.\\n\\nSo, if a pseudovector breaks T-symmetry but not double-T symmetry, what kind of object breaks double-T symmetry?\\n\\nSpinors! A spinor is a pseudovector on steroids. When you apply a single symmetry operation to a spinor, instead of flipping over like a pseudovector, it points into imaginary space. Perform the symmetry operation again, and the spinor ends up as a negative version of the original. Perform the symmetry operation two more times, and you retrieve the original spinor.\\n\\nSo, a spinor breaks double-T symmetry in the same way that a pseudovector breaks single-T, but upholds quad-T in the same way that a pseudovector obeys double-T.\\n\\nURu*_2_*Si*_2_* has the weird magnetic property that, below a certain temperature, its response depends severely on the orientation of the field which you apply to it. The author\\'s explanation of this is (put \"simply\") that the intermolecular interactions cause the field to act as a spinor rather than a pseudovector, hence breaking both single and double T-symmetry. I am unfortunately not able to access the full paper right now because my school\\'s access service for Nature is currently borked, but that\\'s what I can distill from secondary sources.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Blood pressure is the result of a lot of factors affecting blood flow throughout the body that impact the muscle tissue of the heart. Two of the biggest factors include vessel diameter and blood volume. The diameter of a blood vessel may increase or decrease because of a number of physiological or pathological factors. In the case of lowering vessel diameter, less blood can be pumped through per heartbeat. This increases the pressure of the blood against the walls of the vessels. Ultimately the heart has to work extra hard to get the requisite blood to the whole body. Alternatively, increased blood volume has a similar impact, but rises for different reasons.\\n\\nSome foods are implicated in raising blood pressure usually include foods high in salt or saturated fats. Salt in the blood draws water from surrounding tissue do to increased hydrostatic pressure in the blood. The water in surrounding tissues is drawn towards the salty blood, raising blood volume, therefore raising blood pressure. \\n\\nThe way that foods in high saturated fats raise blood pressure is a lot more complicated from a biochemistry standpoint. The big picture is that saturated lipid molecules are subject to certain oxidation reactions which make them antigenic (red flag for the immune system). Increasing fat intake also increases levels of LDL, a lipoprotein that can also be oxidized by various biochemical mechanisms (which usually aren’t happening at bad levels or rates). These oxidized species cause problems in the vasculature and may lead to atherogenic deposits along the vessel lining which reduce the vessel diameter. To get a more detailed explanation of this process, just look up atherosclerosis and atherogenesis. This is fairly typical mechanism for increased blood pressure.',\n",

       "  'text': \"The heart's muscular structure can adapt to physical demand, it is called adaptive cardiac hypertrophy.  However, this can be both good and bad, depending on which parts of the heart are adapting and growing.  Physiological hypertrophy is considered a healthy response to exercise, and can be noted in athletes as 'athlete's heart,' distinguished by a slightly thicker myocardium around the left ventricle. Pathological hypertrophy is unhealthy, however, and can be resultant of a number of complications such as high blood pressure or heart attacks.  The difference is in how the heart changes in size.  Pathological hypertrophy is characterized by 'scar tissue' building up in poor response to compensate poor blood-flow, which over time further strains and weakens the heart.  With athlete's heart, or physiological hypertrophy, the myocardium thickens as to maximize the utilization of the left and right ventricles to pump blood where it needs to go.  The difference is that in athletes, the ventricles (openings) get larger in addition to the muscle walls getting thicker and stronger.  Whereas with bad hypertrophy, the muscle walls get thicker and the ventricles get smaller, decreasing blood capacity.  \\n\\n\\nThe most digestible reading I could find on this is from a study conducted by the Massachusetts General Hospital a little while ago, published by Harvard on their [website](_URL_0_).\\n\\n\\nIf you're up for the reading, this [article](_URL_2_) though old (2003), does a good job of explaining physiological and pathological hypertrophy, and explores the relationships between the two.  \\n\\n\\nAs for the reason your heart doesn't normally feel so 'sore,' this is due to that it is comprised of a different kind of muscle than your regular skeletal muscles, and operates involuntarily thanks to the syncing of your natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial node.  Physically, your skeletal muscle typically has around ~1-2% composition of mitochondria (think of them as energy factories), whilst your striated heart muscles have something between ~20-30%.  This increased buffering capacity for energy in the muscle gives the heart's muscle more juice so to speak, so it doesn't tire. In addition, your heart's muscles spend most of their time relaxing, with only about 1/3 of the heart beat cycle being a contraction. This is all carefully balanced to maximize the heart's utility thanks to the sinoatrial node. The heart's muscle also has a direct blood supply thanks to the coronary arteries (it doesn't get it's oxygenated blood from absorption in the ventricles, as many people wrongly assume).  This combination of specialized arteries, natural pacemaker, and increased energy capacity, yields a specialized muscle that operates without tiring at a nearly perfect level of synchronization.  Really, a marvel of nature.\\n\\n\\nYou can find info on the physiology of the heart just about anywhere.  This short [summary](_URL_1_) by Eric Rosenberger, MD, does a good job of laying it out.

The more \"perfect\" surface is just one way that friction can be reduced.  However, the main reduction in friction comes from using a lubricant on the interface.\\n\\nTo explain how the lubricant reduces friction I am going to use the example of a stationary axle with a moving wheel.  The diameter of the axle will be slightly smaller than the hole in the wheel.  The lubricant will cover the axles surface and will form a very small layer between the inside of the hole and the surface of the axle.  So now instead of two solid surfaces sliding across each other, you have a layer of fluid constantly being \\'sheared\\'.  The forces required to \\'shear\\' this fluid are much less than those required to slide two solid surfaces across each other.\\n\\nHow bearings/bushings are lubricated really depends on the individual bearings design.  But in general, the lubricant is contained in the bearing using something like seals, or the lubricant is continuously pumped through the bearing ensuring the surface stays wet.\\n\\nAdditionally bearings/bushings deteriorate over time.  This happens with all moving parts in machinery, but friction is particularly brutal to the machines.  So it is beneficial to use bearing/bushings because it is much cheaper to replace one small part than the whole axle.',\n",

For example [this](_URL_2_) Wolfram Alpha link shows an alternative definition (that Euler himself used) of \"fraction factorials\". However Gamma is a special function, and you cannot express it using exponentials alone; all definitions will involve derivatives or integrals or series (or other special functions) in some way.\\n\\nStill, the Euler integral of the second kind is perhaps the simplest starting point to prove that its solution satisfies the functional equation of the Gamma function (at least for t > 0). How to come up with it? Difficult to say, but the proof is probably simple enough that you can do it backwards and come up with the integral.\\n\\n >  So how and why are we able to extend this definition into non-integer values or even complex numbers?\\n\\nBecause we can build the analytic continuation of the factorial function, or equivalently because the functional equation n (n-1)! = n! has a solution given by the Euler integral of the second kind (with t=n+1). You can by the way prove that only one analytic function has f(1)=1, f(t+1) = t f(t) and also makes log(f(t)) convex.

This pressure differential causes the future ventricular septum (the endocardial cushions) to bulge to the left. This bulge *somehow* gets incorporated into the mitral valve by fusing two parts of the valve ring into a single leaflet, resulting in two leaflets on the left side. The right side of the heart bulges in the opposite sense, which ends up not fusing two of the three leaflets of the tricuspid valve.\\n\\nTo memorize this, picture a [bishop\\'s mitre](_URL_0_) (hence \"mitral valve\"), and remember that all the other heart valves are tricuspid.

This is one of the reasons they are on interest to geoscientists: they offer a glimpse into the primitive, initial composition of our solar system.\\n\\nHowever, Earth is geologically active. This means that physical and chemical processes are constantly remobilizing, dissolving/precipitating or melting/congealing its constituent minerals. Most of these processes affect individual elements differently, depleting tem here and concentrating them there. \\n\\nPossibly the most important group of processes affecting the remobilization of minerals and their constituent elements are those relating to the flow of water in various environments. Water is present throught the upper lithosphere, in various states of temperature, pressure, eH and pH, and as such will locally dissolve certain minerals and not others, and reprecipitate them elsewhare as it\\'s conditions change. For instance, lets consider [Volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits](_URL_0_). These are the end product of a longish set of complex interaction between seawater and the rocks of the ocean floor. Cold seawater infiltrates into the seafloor by gravity through cracks, fractures and pores and begins a process of convection as it progressively equilibrates its temperature with increasingly warm rocks. It can go down several kilometers, and reach temperatures of a few hundred degrees in the process. This hot water interacts chemically with the mineral species it encounters along the way, and picks up a load of more soluble ions such as iron, copper, zinc, gold, sulphate, chlorine, and several others. Convection then pushes this hot water which is by now quite chemically different from the initial seawater to an exit point on the seafloor, such as a hydrothermal vent which might be a black smoker. As it is released on the ocean floor, this fluid mixes with normal seawater and rapidy cools, decreasing the solubility of it\\'s solute load, and precipitating minerals which accumulate in a mound on the seafloor, thus concentrating in one spot a wealth of metals and such which initially were dispersed throughout a huge volume of country rock.',\n",

And part of it being a Fourier series is that you can go back and forth between frequency space and time space as the two are fully inclusive. If you know the component sinusoids of a periodic continuous function you know the function. If you know the function you can run it through a spectrum analyzer (like your music visualizer) and analyze the frequency component's amplitudes and phases.\\nThe math of why it is only the odd components comes down to how you integrate the square wave function when doing the Fourier series component calculations and I believe you end up with something like a (cos(k*pi) -1) where k is the harmonic and so all the even harmonic wind up with ((1)-1 = 0).\\nA cool way to see it is finding a music program and getting a sine vs a square wave going.

Despite the use of exercise balls in replacement of the office chair, little quantitative evidence exists to support this practice and hence motivated this research. Given the potential for several biological effects and mechanisms this study was approached with several layers of instrumentation to quantify differences in muscle activation, spine posture, spine compression and stability while sitting on an exercise ball versus a stable seat surface. Also, differences in the pressure distribution at the seat–user interface were quantified for the different seat surfaces to provide an objective perspective on the mechanism influencing perceived comfort levels.\\n\\n**Methods**\\n\\n**Eight male subjects volunteered to sit for 30 min on an exercise ball and on a wooden stool. Muscle activity and spine position were used to model spine load and stability. An additional seven sat on an exercise ball and chair to examine pressure distribution over the contact area.**\\n\\n**Findings**\\n\\n**There was no difference in muscle activation profiles of each of the 14 muscles between sitting on the stool and ball. Calculated stability and compression values showed sitting on the ball made no difference in mean response values. The contact area of the seat–user interface was greatest on the exercise ball.**\\n\\n**Interpretation**\\n\\n**The results of this study suggest that prolonged sitting on a dynamic, unstable seat surface does not significantly affect the magnitudes of muscle activation, spine posture, spine loads or overall spine stability. Sitting on a ball appears to spread out the contact area possibly resulting in uncomfortable soft tissue compression perhaps explaining the reported discomfort.**\",\n",

Most of the cancer cells don\\'t look too wrong to the immune system (as they are your own cells, just out of control). The immune system kills them though because they are still wrong looking. The cells which are the least wrong survive and proliferate. Rinse and repeat until you have a cancer which isn\\'t recognised by the immune system\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth thinking about the fact you only \"hear\" about the potentially cancerous cells which make it through the lymph nodes defences. The rest get killed and you\\'re none the wiser; it only takes one in a million cells to get past the defences :)\\n\\n(Sorry for lack of references, on my phone, but I\\'m an immunology student studying for finals ATM for background)\\n\\nTl:dr\\nCancer cells do get recognised, but its sometimes not enough to completely stop them, and they have various methods to stop the immune system or evolve away from recognition.',\n",

Subjects are given three words (e.g., \"crab\", \"pine\", and \"sauce\"), and asked to think of another word that can form a compound word with all three of the ones presented. In this case, the right answer is \"apple\" (crabapple, pineapple, applesauce).\\n\\nBehavioral studies have shown that sometimes people appear to solve these problems slowly and analytically (e.g., think of possible solutions methodically -- crabgrass? pinecone? hotsauce? -- and then test each candidate against the other words until you find one that fits all three), whereas other times the solution just seems to pop out suddenly, with no conscious thought process underlying it.\\nWhen they have people perform this task during EEG or in an fMRI scanner, the most obvious thing that seems to be happening when people get a solution via insight (versus methodically) is a burst of activity in the right temporal cortex at about the same time that they think of the solution.\\n\\nInterestingly, they\\'ve also found that activity PRECEDING the solution makes a difference -- in essence, brain activity is always fluctuating a little bit, and they have found that when activity in the temporal lobes is higher just before the problem is presented, the problem is more likely to be solved via insight than when fluctuations in those areas are lower. (Other studies have had similar findings in other domains -- e.g., that you can predict from moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain activity when a person is in a more alert attentional state and thus likely to respond slightly faster to an unpredictable stimulus.)\\n\\nI\\'ve simplified this answer a bit but if you\\'re interested in reading more, a review article that (I think) is not too hard to read for the well-read layman is [here](_URL_0_).

       "  'text': \"**tl;dr--Any kind of tissue is a rather poor conductor when compared to physical conductors like copper. However, neural tissue is designed to conduct signals through more active, complicated means. Signal velocities can be quite good in the body, and neurons are fantastic signal conductors compared to other tissues, but nowhere near as high as physical conductors.**\\n\\nFirst, some background; \\n\\nThe question itself is a little difficult to address because the way we define conductivity for metals and conductivity for neural tissue is very different. For physical, rather than biological, systems, we employ what's known as Ohm's Law to determine conductivity. Ohm's Law states that the Current density that results from an applied electric field (resulting from a battery, say), is proportional the electrical field multiplied by a constant called the conductivity. In mathematical terms, it's expressed by:\\n\\nJ = pE, where J is the current density, E is the applied electric field, and p is the conductivity. Clearly, the greater the conductivity, the greater the resulting current given a certain applied field.\\n\\nBut the way a neuron conducts an electrical signal is NOT through the generation of an electric field that spans the length of the whole wire (the axon). Rather, as /u/vasavasorum says, it's an active process that involves continually regenerating a potential difference called an *action potential.* Therefore, Ohm's Law doesn't really apply over the length of a neuron's projection to another neuron, because the way signals are conducted over physical wires verses neurons are VERY different. \\n\\nNevertheless, I'll still try to answer this question using some type of analogy. I guess we could make a comparison between wires and neurons by the *speed* at which they conduct signals.\\n\\nMembranes leak ions, and ion concentration differences are what are ultimately responsible for signal propagation in a neuron. The fact that membranes are leaky are what dramatically slows signal propagation in neurons. We make membranes less leaky by an insulating material called myelin in our bodies, and this dramatically increases signal propagation velocities in our brains. Further still, you can increase nerve diameter to increase conduction velocities. Despite this, the highest conduction velocities we get in neurons is a measly 120 m/s. Compare this to wires which communicate at 1/100 the speed of light (that sounds small, but this translates to very nearly 3 million meters per second), and you'll think to yourselves that neurons are actually quite poor conductors.\\n\\nBut they're the best that our bodies have, and they're great for what we need.\",\n",

People do A because you get twice the lifetime, since each battery is doing half the work. People use D to get twice the voltage output of one battery (usually twice 1.2-1.5V = 2.4-3V)\\n\\n In cases B and E you have reversed the voltage that the batteries supply. In simple things like a flashlight with a light bulb, this doesn\\'t do anything. But for an LED (light emitting diode) this is bad, since diodes only allow current in one direction and eventually fry if you put too much voltage in the opposite direction. If your device isn\\'t designed to protect itself, B or E could damage it.\\n\\n In case C you\\'ve basically shorted your batteries! They will discharge quickly and heat up themselves and the wires connecting them; very bad news!\\n\\n In case F, you\\'ve basically put your batteries at cross purposes; assuming they\\'re both the same, each will \"push\" against the other and nothing will happen, since the voltage at the ends of the wire connecting + terminals of each battery is the same, no current will flow. \\n\\n Now, if they aren\\'t the same, it\\'s a different story in case F. Say, one is fresh and the other is dead. The voltage output by the new one is actually a little better than the other, so you might risk actually \"charging\" the dead one at the expense of the new one.

       "  'text': 'Yep, there\\'s a difference. Before I start babbling about branes, let\\'s fix some context:\\n\\nThere are:\\n\\n* precisely five different superstring theories (called type I, heterotic SO(32), heterotic E_8 x E_8, type IIA, and type IIB), all set in 10 dimensions; I will abbreviate these as I, HO, HE, IIA, IIB.\\n* two bosonic string theories in 26D, called closed and open\\n* M-theory, set in 11 dimensions, and not a string theory itself (as I will show later)\\n\\nMoreover, all of these admit a low-energy description, called an effective field theory. For bosonic strings, don\\'t worry about it. For the rest, these are the supergravity (SUGRA) theories:\\n\\n* five 10D supergravities, called like the respective superstring theory (I, HO, HE, IIA, IIB)\\n* the one single 11D supergravity, corresponding to M-theory\\n\\nthe SUGRAs are simply generalizations of general relativity that include supersymmetry, in fact as much as possible of it.\\n\\nOk, we can start.\\n\\n**p-branes**\\n\\np-branes are general p-dimensional objects in supergravity generalizing a black hole (which would be a 0-brane). Since our SUGRAs of interest are set in 10D and 11D, you can have fun building p-dimensional black holes for any p less than the dimension; however there is no guarantee these will be stable objects. If they are suitably charged under the various field of SUGRA (you know how a black hole can have an electric charge? Same thing but there\\'s an f-ton of different charges to have) they can however be \"half-BPS\" or \"extremal\" which means they are as supersymmetric as they can get and so stable. Extremal p-branes are at absolute zero and don\\'t emit any Hawking radiation, just like extremal black holes. Polchinski around 2000 had the intuition that extremal p-branes are just an equivalent description of D-branes. So p-branes in general aren\\'t D-branes but some of them are.\\n\\n**NS branes**\\n\\nNS1-branes are also called F-strings, F for fundamental, and they\\'re just the strings of string theory. There\\'s also another dimensionality of NS-branes that must be paired with NS1-branes for a reason which I\\'ll explain later, so you have:\\n\\n* Superstrings: NS1 and NS5\\n* Bosonic: NS1 and NS21 (I think, at least according to a quick calculation I did in my head).\\n\\nM-theory does not have NS1 and therefore is not a string theory.\\n\\n**D-branes**\\n\\nD-branes only appear in string theory. The defining characteristic is that they are the natural objects on which open strings should be attached. Now this can sound sort of weird, but D-branes aren\\'t actually any kind of additional artificial feature you \"add\" to a string theory, they actually are *made* of strings; they\\'re bound states of strings (just like a black hole is sort of a big ball of gravitons). They\\'re wooly carpets of yarn. The D-brane content depends on specifically which string theory you\\'re in. The list is:\\n\\n* IIA: D0, D2, D4, D6, D8\\n* IIB: D(-1), D1, D3, D5, D7, D9 (you might wonder just wtf would a D(-1)-brane be. The answer is don\\'t think about it)\\n* Bosonic strings: I think no stable D-branes. At least not in the conventional sense.\\n* HE, HO: No D-branes.\\n* I: D1, D5\\n\\nNow, you might notice two things.\\n\\n1) Type I and IIB have stable D1-branes, or D-strings. Are these different from fundamental strings? Yes. They are distinct objects, and have different charges under the various fields. However, if in IIB strings you swap F-strings with D-strings, *and* simultaneously you mix and rearrange together a few of these fields, you find the physics is the same; this symmetry is the celebrated **S-duality**, in the case of IIB is a self-duality as the theory maps to itself. S-duality also swaps NS5 and D5 branes.\\n\\n2) the lists above are symmetric about the D3 brane. I.e., if there\\'s a Dp-brane there\\'s also a D(6-p)-brane. This is part of a more general correspondence in d spacetime dimensions between k-dimensional objects and (d-4-k)-dimensional ones, electric-magnetic duality or Hodge duality. This is the same duality that in our d=4 world relates electric with magnetic fields and point charges (0D) with hypothetical monopoles (4-4-0=0D). That\\'s how and why I guessed bosonic strings had an NS21 brane for example.\\n\\n**M-branes**\\n\\nM-branes are just the branes of M-theory. M-theory has exclusively stable M2 and M5 branes. Note that M-branes also respect Hodge duality, this time with d=11.\\n\\n**Other**\\n\\nThere\\'s other kinds of exotic branes all around actually, but for the sake of clarity we\\'re going to stop here.',\n",

That\\'s just a myth. But this myth seems to have obscured the reality of the situation. ADHD is usually treated with dopamine agonists and it is believed that individuals with ADHD have problems with dopamine signals. So we give them drugs that \"amplify\" dopamine signals similar to how we give deaf people devices that amplify auditory signals. Excessive intake of sugar in individuals with certain genetic predispositions may lead to a reduction of dopamine (D2) receptors. Why? The reward hub of your brain, the nucleus accumbens, adjusts to the relative sizes of rewards in your environment. When it has become adjusted to large rewards (sugar), it gets less sensitive to smaller rewards. This leads to problems of concentration and motivation. Bear in mind, this is just a hypothesis. \\n\\n > We postulate that sugar acutely increases dopamine, which, over time, leads to a reduced number of D2 receptors and possibly a reduction in extracellular dopamine itself, leading to desensitization of this dopamine signaling axis.

Our findings provide a novel mechanism by which a human commensal bacterium can improve ASD-related GI deficits and behavioral abnormalities in mice, possibly explaining the rapid increase in ASD prevalence by identifying the microbiome as a critical environmental contributor to disease. We propose the transformative concept that autism is, at least in part, a disease involving the gut that impacts the immune, metabolic and nervous systems, and that microbiome-mediated therapies may be a safe and effective treatment for ASD.\\n\\n**Physical exercise**\\n\\nIt is a common myth that you don\\'t grow new neurons during your lifetime.
