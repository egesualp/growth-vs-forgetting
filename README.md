# Gradual Growth vs Naive Learning in Continuous Learning Scenarios

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for comparing **gradual growth methods**, specifically the G_stack approach, with **naive models trained from scratch**. The project focuses on addressing **catastrophic forgetting** and improving model performance in continuous learning scenarios.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

1. Compare the effectiveness of G_stack and naive models in continuous learning tasks.
2. Investigate the impact of **deterministic** and **probabilistic fine-tuning** on model performance.
3. Analyze how these methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting when revisiting the same task and dataset over time.
